* DRAFT Freedom!                                                   :tech:oss:

I came across GNU's list of [[https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html][Free Distros]] recently.

What I want:
- test-drive as VM ([[Windows on Linux][Qemu with virt-manager]])
- work on my laptop
- relatively painless (be productive quickly)
- pleasing on the eye

To get networking in the guest I had to select NAT for network source and "hypervisor default" for device model as my NIC.

I gave the following distros a quick spin:
- [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Running-Guix-in-a-VM.html][GUIX]]: Running quickly but after that the going gets rough.
- [[https://pureos.net/][PureOS]]: looks good (GNOME).
- [[https://trisquel.info/][Trisquel]]

* DRAFT How to make impossible choices        :productivity:org:emacs:coding:

Life is full of impossible choices. In those cases I follow these conservative but practical rules:
- When in doubt, stay on the same road.
- If it's not broken, don't fix it.

Let me give you some examples:

** Emacs vs other editors

I keep bouncing back and forth between [[https://emacs.org][Emacs]] and other text editors (most recently: [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]]) for coding.

Current editors like VSCode are just more modern. Many things are so much easier. And the main selling feature of Emacs, "the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html][extensible, customizable]] editor", is now also available in editors [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][like]] VSCode. You have a virtually unlimited choice of plugins and can relatively easily program your own. In Javascript and not [[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/][elisp]] (Lisp is an elegant language, but just not for everyone).

One thing that keeps driving me back to Emacs is that the key bindings are in my muscle memory. To outsiders they may seem archaic and mysterious, but to me they feel comfortable and homey. When I just /think/ of opening a file, my fingers want to go =C-x C-f=. And Emacs allows me to mostly stay away from the mouse, which saves me time and context switches.

But, at the same time, that's also one of the major down-sides of Emacs: every time I switch to another application, my mind has to switch to other key bindings. All of a sudden the ubiquitous =C-x= and =C-c= of Emacs have become =cut= and =copy=. And when I hit =C-w= (=kill-region=) to cut a piece of text, instead I close a tab. This switching is an annoying mental effort and /very/ error prone. Of course, I am aware of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/CUA-Bindings.html][CUA mode]] but I prefer to use every tool as it was intended.

But the killer app that currently drove me back to Emacs is [[/what-is-org-mode][Org mode]]. There is nothing comparable.

_Result_: For now, I am back using Emacs, but I can already feel the rising frustration with the lack of compatibility with other apps, so at some point I will probably change back.

** Literate coding or comments

As an org mode user, literate programming is all the rage, with [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]] to 'untangle'. Emacs configs in an org mode document [[https://www.google.com/search?q=org+mode+emacs+config][abound]] online. And they /do/ make for very nicely readable documents. So, I have long intended to try this approach but never came round to it.

In the end, the extra indirection and level of complexity added by literate programming need to be justified by some benefit. So, unless you are writing a book or blog posts, code comments are the easiest way to document code.

_Result_: I just add comments.

** Where to put stuff

Many things can (or should) be stored only once. For example, a book, a piece of code, or the contact information of your doctor. But to be able to find them, it may be useful to store them in different places. A book, for example, can be stored alphabetically by title, by author, or by subject. But if you have only one copy (and why shouldn't you), you can only store it in one place at a time.

Fortunately, especially with digital data, indexing and searching make this a non-issue. For example, I used to label all my emails, but these days I just archive them and search.

** Programming language

[[https://www.python.org/][Python]] has long been my go to programming language, but I find I am moving more and more towards [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript][Javascript]].

** Emacs completion framework

Completion makes life so much easier. On the command line first bash, but these days [[https://ohmyz.sh/][Oh My ZSH!]].

* DRAFT The sex/favor-exchange                                      :society:

To me, the current MeToo-movement is all about the classical sex/favor-exchange: some men try to buy sex with favors (e.g. power or money), while some women use their sexuality for favors. (To keep things as simple as possible, I'll ignore for now that it's not always men who provide the favor and not always women who provide the sex.)

Some people may have a problem with this exchange for principal reasons, but personally I have no problem with it, as long as the exchange is transparent and with mutual consent.

The trouble starts when the exchange is
- not transparent :: either party did expect more from the exchange (e.g. a committed relationship),
- not with mutual consent :: either party is not interested in sex with the other,
- simply fails :: the sex is not reciprocated with the expected favor, or vice versa. When the exchange is not transparent

Unfortunately, it is very hard to tell after the fact how parties originally went into the exchange. Traditionally, this means that it is very hard for women to prove they did not want the exchange since the beginning. Currently, it is also very hard for men to prove that the exchange was consensual from both sides.

In my opinion nobody should ever be forced to perform or receive sexual acts, but in the current MeToo-narrative, the possibility that there may originally have been a transparent and consensual exchange seems to be completely ignored. When a woman realizes (or decides) years after the fact that in retrospect the act was not consensual, she suddenly becomes a victim. And the man a horrible rapist.

* DRAFT Gender and sexuality                                        :society:

In our times, a lot of attentions goes to gender and sexuality. So, I thought I would record my views on these.

** Gender

I believe gender is not binary. Instead, it is a scale. You could represent someone's gender with a slider:

#+begin_src bash
male |--+-------------------| female
#+end_src

On this scale, I would position myself on the male end. I feel male, I identify as male, but I don't think e.g. aggression is required for a male.

I think 80-90% of the population belong to the male or female ends of the scale. Consequently, 10-20% are somewhere in the middle. These people consider themselves both male and female, or neither. Some may feel more male during one period, and more female during the next. And many more alternatives exist.

Still, in my opinion, it makes sense to organize our society as if gender /is/ binary, because for most people it is. But I understand this makes life harder for people in the middle of the scale. I think we should allow for this group, but I don't think we can expect society to cater all possible genders. So for instance, organizations should only ask for gender on a form when it is relevant. And when relevant, options male, female, and other are sufficient (no need to further specify the "other" category).

There are different aspects to this scale, for instance:
- people's idea of their gender may change during their lifetime or even from one period to the next
- there may be a gap between the gender people identify with and the gender of their bodies (they feel they are in the wrong body)
- there may be a gap between the gender people identify with and the gender society assigns to them

One of the issues I have with the current attention to non-binary genders, is that almost all teenagers go through a phase in which they are unsure about who they are. They feel unsure about their body. They don't feel as if they belong anywhere. I feel like currently these youngster are pushed towards the conclusion that these doubts mean they have a non-binary gender, while instead they are just experiencing normal growing pains. This may force gender issues on them, where there were none.

Don't get me wrong, I think we should take gender issues seriously, but I fear changing your gender may not solve the problems you hoped it would, and on top of that add a whole new set of problems that you didn't have before.

** Sexuality

I use a similar scale for sexual orientation:

#+begin_src bash
heterosexual |+---------------------| homosexual
#+end_src

Here I think 60-70% of people are on the hetero side of the scale, while 5-10% are on the homosexual end of the scale. The 20-30% in the middle may be bisexual, asexual or something else. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation][Surveys]] indicate these numbers are 80% hetero, 3% homosexual and 5% other. Apart from several [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation#Research_issues][research issues]] results differ between genders, countries, generations and periods.

Regardless of the exact numbers, I think being heterosexual is the easiest, so some people in the middle (and even at the homosexual end) may choose to live as heterosexuals. Fortunately, current culture where I live, especially among young people, more and more allows for other sexual orientations, even allowing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fluidity][sexual fluidity]].

Personally, I do not see why sexuality should be as rigid and binary as it has been in the past. Procreation is biological, but sexuality is more than procreation, and can therefore be more personal and cultural.

* DRAFT VS Code                                                   :emacs:dev:

Over the last year, or so, I have been drawn to VS Code again. And I like it.

But what does VS Code that Emacs doesn't?

Basically, it is just these few things:
- It Just Works\trade
  When I open a file, VS Code suggests extensions I can use. Just click "install" and you're good to go.
- Integrated debugger

Het is verschrikkelijk dat er vele arbeiders zijn omgekomen bij de bouw van de voetbalstadions in Qatar. Of dat nu tientallen, honderden, of duizenden arbeiders waren.

Maar is het niet net zo verschrikkelijk dat er jaarlijks miljoenen mensen omkomen van de honger, terwijl wij het graan dat hen had kunnen voeden gebruiken om het vee vet te mesten voor onze dagelijkse homp vlees? Of net zo verschrikkelijk als de duizenden vluchtelingen die jaarlijks omkomen op de Middellandse Zee, omdat we hen onze welvaart niet gunnen? Of als de miljoenen arbeiders in verre landen die werken onder embarmelijke omstandigheden om bij ons de schappen van de ALDI, de Action en de Primark gevuld te houden?

We hebben in het Rijke Westen natuurlijk veel bereikt in de laatste pakweg honderd jaar, zoals stemrecht voor vrouwen, openbaar onderwijs, recht op abortus en euthanasie, en het homohuwelijk. Maar bedenk dat we niet veel verder terug hoeven te gaan dan die honderd jaar, dat ons land in veel leek op het Qatar van nu: rijke industri√´len / landeigenaren / oliesjeiks maken de dienst uit ten koste van het lagere volk. En mogen we die voortuigang aan andere landen opdringen, als we er zelf nog maar zo kort mee hebben ge√´xperimenteerd?

Bovendien: vooruitgang? Laten we er eens met een niet-Westerse blik naar kijken. Dan zou je kunnen zeggen dat de bandeloosheid al zo is ge√Ønstitutionaliseerd dat abortus legaal is en de pil voor heel jonge meisjes in het basispakket. Je zou ook kunnen zeggen dat de zedeloosheid zo uit de hand is gelopen dat rokjes omhoog zijn gekropen tot in het kruis en decollet√©s afgedaald tot de navel. Je zou kunnen zeggen dat mensen die demonstreren tegen het overheidsbeleid door de politie worden [[https://nos.nl/l/2454599][ge√Øntimideerd]] of zelfs voor de [[https://nos.nl/l/2453262][rechtbank]] moeten verschijnen. En kinderen spreken hun ouders niet meer aan met "u", maar met "jij", en soms zelfs met de voornaam, waarbij die vaak "klootzak" en "trut" lijken te luiden.

We hebben boter op ons hoofd en enige bescheidenheid zou ons sieren.

Want een inclusieve samenleving is niet alleen voor de linkse elite. Het is ook voor de voetballer die niet de One Love aanvoerdersband wil dragen. En voor hen die samenzweringstheori√´n aanhangen omdat ze het geloof in de wetenschap al lang geleden hebben verloren. En voor de rechtse rakker die zich allang niet meer gehoord en gezien voelt door politiek Den Haag. En voor de vlogger die zijn mening niet vertegenwoordigd ziet in de mainstream media.

Volgens mij is er nog ontzettend veel te bereiken in de eigen regio, voor we al te hoog van de toren blazen naar de rest van de wereld. Laten we ons daar nu eerst eens op focussen. Een beetje ongemakkelijk misschien, maar wel net zo zinvol.

I have migrated from [[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/][winget]] to [[https://scoop.sh/][scoop]]. Winget is a big stap up from manually downloading and installing applications, but in the end it is mainly just a wrapper around the application installer. You still get installer popups, which started to get under my skin.

So far, scoop works great:
- I have reinstalled all applications (except those from Microsoft, just to stay in touch with the Microsoft way of installing).
- installation is much faster
- you get parallel downloads with [[http://aria2.github.io/][aria2]] and administrator access with sudo
- no more setup dialogues

The main downside is that spplication icons seem to get lost, somehow. They are visible in =~/scoop/apps=, but not in =~/scoop/shims=. Also, some apps (like NotePad++) open a terminal when they start from a file association in file explorer.

I also kept Docker under winget, because I couldn't get =dockerd= working properly. You need to start it as administrator, but than =docker-compose= needs to be run as administrator too. And that doesn't play well with the Docker extension in VSCode. It's probably just me, but after some trial and error I decided it was easier to switch back to Docker Desktop through winget.

* PUBLISHED The Hypervisor Conundrum                                :windows:
CLOSED: [2022-06-21 Tue 09:54]

Windows 11 Pro came pre-installed with a set of [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/][virtualization features]]:
- Microsoft's own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor][hypervisor]]: [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/][Hyper-V]]
  - Hyper-V Managament Tools
    - Hyper-V GUI Management Tools
    - Hyper-V Module for Windows PowerShell
  - Hyper-V Platform
    - Hyper-V Hypervisor (/We'll come back to this one later/)
    - Hyper-V Services
- Virtual Machine Platform
- Windows Hypervisor Platform
- Windows Sandbox
- Windows Subsystem for Linux

Despite my [[New laptop arrived][misgivings]] about Hyper-V itself, I was pleasantly surprised that WSL now included [[WSL GUI][graphical abilities]]. It also turned out that Docker used WSL, which in retrospect was a sign of what was to come.

Last week I decided to experiment with pen-testing. The industry standard for a pen-testing lab seemed to be [[https://www.kali.org/][Kali Linux]] on [[https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines][VirtualBox]]. So, =winget install virtualbox= and I'd be ready to go. Or so I thought.

Modern computers come with hardware support for virtualization. The thing is that only one application can use this support at any one time. And on Windows that is Hyper-V, so when Hyper-V is running, other hypervisors need to access the virtualization hardware support /through/ Hyper-V. Which makes VirtualBox painfully slow: I had ample time to admire the frames in the animated Kali-logo.

To disable all virtualization features, you need to perform some arcane [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v#how-to-disable-hyper-v][magic]]. And with Hyper-V disabled, WSL and Docker also go out the Window (/sic/), so I would have to switch on a regular basis. This is highly simplified by [[https://unclassified.software/en/apps/hypervswitch][HyperVSwitch]] (be careful: it reboots your machine without warning), but I would still need to restart my system every time...

Internet [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/69896662/5251833][posts]] kept telling me it's possible to have WSL and VirtualBox running simultaneously, because WSL uses the Hyper-V /architecture/ but not the Hyper-V /feature/. After completely [[https://pureinfotech.com/uninstall-wsl2-windows-10/][uninstalling WSL]] (and turning of /all/ virtualization features, and rebooting) and then =wsl --install= (and rebooting) only the features /Virtual Machine Platform/ and /Windows Subsystem for Linux/ were back on again. WSL was now running fine, but VirtualBox was crawling in software virtualization mode.

Running =bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off= (and rebooting) allowed VirtualBox to run in hardware virtualization mode, but now WSL stopped working: =Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS=.

So, with =hypervisorlaunchtype off=, VirtualBox is fine, but WSL is not. And with =hypervisorlaunchtype auto=, WSL is fine, but VirtualBox is painfully slow in software virtualization mode. And switching requires a reboot. Every time.

So, after three weeks of using Windows, I am considering moving back to Linux again...

My [[New laptop][new laptop]] arrived 'early' (May 31 instead of Jun 21: good marketing by Dell). These are my experiences so far with my intention to work under Windows instead of Ubuntu.

- On the surface, Windows 11 isn't that much different from Windows 10. It may be very different under the hood, but I can't tell.
- The [[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/][winget]] package manager works like a charm. I also installed apps through the store, just to experience the difference, but winget has a much wider choice. The weird thing is, that removing an app must still be done by selecting "Uninstall" in the start menu...
- [[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/terminal/][Windows Terminal]] works fine and I may get used to [[https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/][PowerShell]] as well.
- I am having trouble using [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/][Hyper-V]]:
  - I can't share folders between the host and guest, like I am used to in e.g. VirtualBox. There is [[https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win][usbipd.win]] and you can of course use "Sharing" (i.e. Samba).
  - I can't set the display resolution in Debian other than through Grub.
- Migrating [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] was fairly painless. I just needed to set =$HOME=, install [[https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#C-Compiler-for-Windows][MSys2]] for Org-roam and adding MSys's =/usr/bin= to my path. MSys2 also removed my need for [[https://www.cygwin.com/][cygwin]].
- I also created =$HOME/bin= and added it to =$PATH= (mainly for sqlite)
- It turns out [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker Desktop]] needs [[https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/][WSL]] (Windows Subsystem for Linux), so as I no longer need Cygwin, I decided to install Debian just for the fun of it (so far, I have no real need for it).

On top of my original plan, I installed some additional apps:
- Dev:
  - [[https://www.sqlite.org/][SQLite]] (in =$HOME/bin=)
  - [[https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows][nvm for Windows]]
  - [[https://winmerge.org/][WinMerge]]
  - [[https://dbeaver.io/][DBeaver]]
  - [[https://www.lazarus-ide.org/][Lazarus]]
- Utilities:
  - [[https://www.7-zip.org/][7-zip]]
  - [[https://notepad-plus-plus.org/][Notepad++]] (associated with all text files instead of VSCode)
  - I tried [[https://files.community/][Files]] as a tabbed file explorer, but found it too flaky, so now I am trying [[https://doublecmd.sourceforge.io/][Double commander]], even though I am not that fond of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Dual-pane_managers][dual-pane managers]]
  - [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] to share my org files between machines (not really needed any more, now I am exclusively on Windows, but you never know...)
  - [[https://rclone.org/][rclone]] (in =$HOME/bin=) for on-site and off-site backups
  - [[https://www.putty.org/][Putty]]
  - [[https://rufus.ie/][Rufus]]
  - [[https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free][TreeSize Free]]
  - [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/][PowerToys]]
  - [[https://www.sysinternals.com][sysinternals]]
- Productivity
  - [[https://libreoffice.org/][LibreOffice]] although I use Google Docs when I can and Microsoft Office when I have to
  - [[https://www.teamviewer.com/][TeamViewer]]
  - [[https://zoom.us/][Zoom]]

My intention is to install server components like [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment?view=sql-server-ver16&pivots=cs1-bash][MSSQL]] through docker.

Apps I like but don't need (yet):
- [[https://www.jenkins.io/][Jenkins]] CI/CD
- [[https://filezilla-project.org/][FileZilla]] because most of my customers use [[https://winscp.net/][WinSCP]] and using the same tool makes communication easier
- [[https://www.audacityteam.org/][Audacity]] sound editor
- [[https://www.openshot.org/][OpenShot]] video editor
- [[https://inkscape.org/][InkScape]] vector-based drawing

* PUBLISHED Emacs + GPG = EasyPG                               :tech:windows:
CLOSED: [2022-06-06 Mon 11:09]

I looked at [[https://keepass.info/][KeePass]] to store confidential information on Windows. But then it occured to me that org files can easily be encrypted, so now I use that instead.

Just add the extension =.gpg= to your file (so =vault.org= becomes =vault.org.gpg=) and you're good to go. The double extension lets Emacs know its both encrypted and an org file.

If you want to hide that the file is an org file, you can even rename your file to just e.g. =vault.gpg= and start your file with:
#+begin_src org
# -*- coding: utf-8; mode: org -*-
#+end_src

I love how org mode turns out to be the perfect PIM with every new step. And I was glad to find that EasyPG worked out of the box even on Windows.

The only downside was that you need to enter your password in a popup window, instead of in the minibuffer. This is easily remedied by customizing =(epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)=.

I maintain a number of websites for different clients and need to monitor their status. At this point a simple check if the site is still up would be sufficient, so I would prefer something simple. Other requirements: open source, self-hosted, configurable, web dashboard, automatic alerts and preferably available through docker compose.

Candidates:
- [[https://www.nagios.org/][Nagios]] claims to be the industry standard for system monitoring but is a bit too much for me. There's also its open source fork [[https://icinga.com/][Icinga]].
- [[https://www.zabbix.com/][Zabbix]] looks overly complicated
- [[https://github.com/sanathp/statusok][StatusOK]] looks like it does exactly what I want, but seems to be discontinued.
- [[https://dashy.to/][Dashy]]

I also checked others, but found nothing I liked. I also checked if there's a suitable Python module, but also no luck.

So, maybe roll my own? [[https://projectgurukul.org/python-website-monitoring/][This]] seems a start, and [[https://gist.github.com/adeekshith/fef4ff9949b88ce102bd][here]], [[https://motoma.io/basic-server-monitoring-with-python/][here]], and [[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-script-to-monitor-website-changes/][here]] is more inspiration.

What really worries me, is that we make tech giants responsible for
the behavior of their users, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility][with great responsibility comes great power]] (sic).
The result could be that Google [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9837][controls]] what information
journalists and scholars may collect and share.

I believe that the underlying issue why disinformation is such a

and the very journalists and scholars we suppress are our best bet on
restoring faith.

Instead of blaming big tech and forcing them to police the internet,
we should let everybody do what they are meant for: companies make
money, governments protect their citizens, journalists seek truth,

what is right and what is wrong? Those we decide together, in open

I used to have Emacs keybindings for files I visit often, like my Emacs config and my org notes. This was fast, but felt a bit overdone, and kept me from accessing too many files this way, because remembering the keybindings would be tedious.

And then I remembered Emacs has bookmarks, which I had used in the past. This takes a few more key strokes (=C-x r b <first letter of bookmark> TAB=), but I only have to remember the one keybinding, and can then store as many bookmarks as I like, including remote files with Tramp and git repositories with Magit. At the moment, I have close to 20 of them.

I use Emacs and org-mode on a daily basis for work. And I use a tablet for on-the-couch surfing. When I find something interesting I record a link in =mobile.org= through [[http://www.orgzly.com/help][Orgzly]], and refile it to my =links.org=  when I am back in Emacs.

However, this leaves me with an endless list of URLs, which take a lot of work to be manually converted to org-mode sections headers with a link and tags. So, the last couple of days I wrote an Emacs package that does just that automatically: [[https://github.com/vrind-nl/bag.el][bag.el]].

I have been programming since the 1980s, and professionally since the 1990s. And I am still learning. Recently this has been mainly from studying other people's code.

For example, I work with highly technical code in C with lots of hardware interfaces and mathematical algorithms. The existing code is strictly organized and was written by a very disciplined developer. This level of structure and discipline helps me to write code like that myself.

As another example, I have been browsing through some code Emacs Lisp lately, like the very basic [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/simple.el][simple.el]]. As Emacs is "self-documenting", comments are an integral part of elisp to begin with, and developers have clearly taken care to explain their code where they saw fit. Although I think that comments can be [[https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/opinion-pieces/fighting-evil-code-comments-comments/][evil]] at worst and are a code-smell at best, good comments can be really valuable, and I can learn from the way Emacs modules have been documented.

I was reading, as one does on a Sunday morning, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp]] and came across the statement [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Truth-_0026-Falsehood.html][‚Äúfalse‚Äù is just our old friend nil. Anything else‚Äîanything at all‚Äîis ‚Äútrue‚Äù]].

Which made me blink, because in most other programming languages this is not the case. So, I checked, and found the statement to be correct (duh\trade):

#+begin_src bash
 *** Welcome to IELM ***  Type (describe-mode) for help.
ELISP> (not nil)
t
ELISP> (not 0)
nil
ELISP> (not "")
nil
#+end_src

I would expect elisp to be similar to other scripted languages. For example, Javascript has a whole list of [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy][falsy]] values, including (testing with negation, to cast to boolean):

#+begin_src bash
Welcome to Node.js v12.21.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> !undefined
true
> !0
true
> !""
true
#+end_src

Or in [[https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html][Python]]:

#+begin_src bash
Python 3.9.5 (default, May 11 2021, 08:20:37)
[GCC 10.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> not None
True
>>> not 0
True
>>> not ""
True
#+end_src

Or maybe elisp would be closer to C, because that's what its base functions are written in. But even that is a bit different:

#+begin_src c
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main() {
    printf("NULL = %d\n", !NULL);
    printf("0 = %d\n", !0);
    printf("\"\" = %d\n", !"");
  }
#+end_src

gives

#+begin_src sh
  NULL = 1
  0 = 1
  "" = 0
#+end_src

So, elisp is unlike any other language I know. Weird (but so are [[https://blog.robertelder.org/weird-c-syntax/][C]], [[https://colab.research.google.com/github/satwikkansal/wtfpython/blob/master/irrelevant/wtf.ipynb#scrollTo=mW-Bnl_i1u6v][Python]] and [[https://jsisweird.com/][JS]]).

My laptop has 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. I ran Windows 10 and Ubuntu in dual-boot mode for years, but switching back-and-forth drove me crazy, so about a year ago I started using [[Windows on Linux][Windows on Linux]] in a virtual machine.

But I still kept my Windows 10 dual-boot as fall-back, which meant Windows and Ubuntu had to share my 512GB storage. Windows was getting the lion share, because I had been unable to shrink its partition to less than about 270GB and I had the Windows VM on Linux which was gobbling up over 40GB extra of the Ubuntu partition (and growing), which left Ubuntu about 200GB.

The storage limitation was starting to annoy me. Mostly, because it kept me from installing Visual Studio on the Windows VM, without freeing space first. So, I decided to wipe my Windows partition and grow the Ubuntu one:

1. The Windows partition was easily removed with the Ubuntu =disks= tool.
2. It turned out you can't resize a partition you're running from, so I made myself a [[https://gparted.org/livecd.php][parted live USB]] and booted from it. Which sounds easier than it actually was, because of /secure boot/ issues, but in the end I managed to grow the Ubuntu partition.
3. And then nothing, because [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2][GRUB]] got lost along the way. The suggested [[https://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=help-manual&lang=C#gparted-fix-grub-boot-problem][solution]] from the =parted= FAQ didn't solve it, but it did allow me to explore my file system. I found that I somehow trashed my =grub.cfg= (probably when I played around with =grub-install=), which left grub without a clue what to do. Restoring a backup solved that problem.

Ubuntu now lives on a whopping 500GB partition, which hopefully extends the life-span of my laptop with at least another year or so.

I wanted to replicate the following function from [[http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/][Javascript md5 module]] in Emacs lips:

#+begin_src js
  function b64_md5(s) { return rstr2b64(rstr_md5(str2rstr_utf8(s))); }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The nested functions are:
1. =str2rstr_utf8= encodes a string as utf-8, assuming it is utf-16
2. =rster_md5= calculates the md5 of a raw string
3. =rstr2b64= converts a raw string to a base-64 string

Outputs:

#+begin_src js
  str2rstr_utf8("test");      // "test"
  rstr_md5("test");           // "\t¬èk√çF!√ìs√ä√ûN¬É&'¬¥√∂"
  rstr2b64("test");           // "dGVzdA"
  rstr2b64(rstr_md5("test"))  // "CY9rzUYh03PK3k6DJie09g"
#+end_src

I could quite easily find some elisp functions that may be equivalent:

| Javascript md5 | Elisp                |
|----------------+----------------------|
| =str2rstr_utf8=  | =encode-coding-string= |
| =rster_md5=      | =secure-hash=          |
| =str2b64=        | =base64-encode-string= |

On closer inspection I figured I would not need =encode-coding-string= because [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/13/][Emacs]] already uses UTF8 encoding internally, while  [[https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding][Javascript]] uses UTF-16.

It turns out that the other two elisp functions are close matches to their JS counterparts:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (base64-encode-string "test")   ; "dGVzdA", same as rstr2b64
   (secure-hash 'md5 "test")       ; "098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6"
                                   ; which is HEX for "	¬èk√çF!√ìs√ä√ûN¬É&'¬¥√∂"
#+end_src

So, I need a function to [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12003231/how-do-i-convert-a-string-of-hex-into-ascii-using-elisp][decode a HEX string]]:

Emacs is stable. You can get back to it after years, and immediately be productive. That's why my alternative editor keeps changing (UltraEdit, Sublime, VSCode), but Emacs has been a recurring thing since the early nineties.

For instance, I was editing an extensive code comment lately, and my fingers just went =M-q= to word wrap the comment block. I hadn't done that since the years I read email with RMAIL (early nineties), but without thinking, the key combination happened.

Compared to Emacs, most text editors (like VSCode) are glorified typewriters.

People handle stress in projects in different ways. I find it helpful to use an analogy with electrical components:

- stress resistor :: Some people shield others from stress. They pass on what needs to be done, but shield the team from negative pressure. They seem to think that passing on stress does not help productivity.
- stress conductor :: Some people pass on stress to others. They seem to think that the team needs to share the stress they're under themselves to help them prioritize.
- stress amplifyer :: Some people forward stress to the team with extra emphasis. They seem to think this spurs them on.

I have my preferences, but I actually think neither of these options is either good or bad. The most effective strategy is highly situational, and depends for instance on the individual characters, the atmosphere in the team, and the phase of the project. So, I think a good project manager can switch based on the circumstances.

It has been almost a [[COVID-19][year]] since my first post on COVID-19. And I am starting to suffer from a mild form of the Corona Blues:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The condition of depression and hopelessness caused by COVID-19 measures.
#+END_QUOTE

Initially I thought it would be over soon. Even later, I could see light at the end of the tunnel. But it is getting harder and harder to have faith that the current measures will get us out of this mess.

Here in the Netherlands we are in our strictest lockdown since the start of this pandemic:
- only one visitor a day, which means that my mother cannot come and visit, because at her age she needs someone to accompany her
- work at home as much as possible, which means some workers have not met their colleagues in person for almost a year
- schools are closed, which means our children in college have been studying almost exclusively at home for almost a year now. They struggle (and by now start to fail) to keep up the motivation and self discipline.
- no sports, theater, hair dressers, traveling, shopping, museums, restaurants, etc., which means it feels like life is reduced to /sleep, eat, work, repeat/.
- other illnesses (like cancer) get treated later and slower, and loved ones are severely limited in their ability to support patients
- curfew between 9 pm and 4.30 am, which is mostly a psychological burden

I actually am proud of our household: so far, we have managed to keep our spirits up and avoided serious conflicts. To be honest, others are (far) worse off than I am:
- I already worked mostly from home
- our children are at an age that they take care of themselves
- our income has not suffered

CLOSED: [2021-02-24 wo 19:06]

I have been crunching some numbers.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we have had a little over a million contaminations in [[https://eenvandaag.avrotros.nl/coronacrisis/coronacrisis-in-cijfers/besmettingen-doden-en-ziekenhuisopnames-in-nederland/][Holland]] and a little over fifteen thousand casualties in a few days short of a year (1.038.156 and 15.017 on February 17, 2021 respectively).

We [[https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-covid-19/grafieken][know]] that 90% of casualties is over 70 and two thirds is over 80, and in [[https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/onderwerp/levensverwachting/cijfers-context/huidige-situatie][Holland]] life expectancy is a little over 80. When we combine age distribution of casualties with their life expectancy, we can calculate that we have lost a staggering 136.5 thousand life years to the virus so far (a little over 9 years per casualty).

Now the opposite side of the coin.

We have had restrictive measures for almost a year now and the effects are beginning to [[https://coronabarometer.nl/][show]], including depression, obesitas and loss of fitness. A way to measure this is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year][Quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY). If we assume that the quality of life of all Dutch has been reduced by an average of [[https://www.umcg.nl/w/nieuws/mentale-gezondheid-daalt-tot-dieptepunt-sinds-begin-coronacrisisnews][10 percent]] we have lost almost 1.75 million QALYs this year alone. This gets worse if the quality of life deteriorates more, and this counter keeps running as long as the measures are maintained.

But even if the corona measures were lifted as of today, we would still feel their consequences. Health care to non-corona patients has been delayed or reduced, with predictable effects. We spent and lost billions during the last year, which we can no longer spend on other causes like health, education or culture. But most of all, the mental damage we have done will have long-lasting effects. Social lives have been damaged, including healthy development of young people. If we assume that it will take us 10 years to fully recover from this, we will loose a multiple of the 1.75 million QALYs before this is all over.

The losses from the virus are horrible. However, if we consider a life year and a QALY to be equal, and we accept the assumptions above, the losses of the current corona measures are over ten times worse. But they are less clearly visible: there is no funeral for a youth who lost 0.2 QALY this year. And the equality of life years and QALYs is debatable: the youth is still there, struggling through each day, but alive. I find it impossible to compare the death of one elderly (9 life years) to the loss of 0.2 QALY of 45 youths (9 QALYs in total), but I think they're both significant.

When we extrapolate the death rate to the whole Dutch [[https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/visualisaties/bevolkingsteller][population]] we might loose 2.4 million life years (262 thousand casualties) if we let the virus run free. This might get worse, because hospitals (and Intensive Care units in particular) will get overwhelmed. It may also be less, because the virus will probably die out before contamination of the whole population (at some point we will reach [[https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19][herd immunity]]).

I am aware that this reasoning is debatable, and the numbers are full of assumptions and estimates. But at some point the damage of the corona measures /will/ overtake the loss from corona itself. Some may think we are already way past this point. Others may feel we still have a long way to go. Personally, I find it hard to pinpoint where we stand, but regardless, let's hope we soon start seeing the [[https://nos.nl/artikel/2370107-rivm-gunstig-vaccinatie-effect-zichtbaar-in-verpleeghuizen.html][effects]] of vaccination.

I have been running Windows and Linux side-by-side in dual-boot since forever. Switching between OSs this way is a pain, but the best I could get for a long time. Worse, the dual-boot configuration seems to hamper the Windows update process, so my Windows 10 version was beginning to get outdated.

Previously I have considered:
- Running Windows 10 in a VM on a Ubuntu host with an illegal version of Windows (which I object to) or buying an extra license (which feels stupid, because my laptop came with Windows pre-installed).
- Running Ubuntu in a VM on a Windows host, which felt like adding insult to injury.

[[Virtual Machine Management][Recently]] I rediscovered Qemu, which rekindled my interest in virtual machines (which I had sort of written off since my switch from Vagrant to Docker). But from Apple users I heard of [[https://www.parallels.com/][Parallels]] and how conveniently it merged the MacOS and Windows environments, so I started considering getting a MacBook. But I didn't want to give up on Linux just yet.

And then I found [[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-windows-10-in-a-vm-on-a-linux-machine/][this]] article, which pointed me to the ~acpica-tools~. With it, you can retrieve your Windows 10 product key. So now I simply did:
1. install Qemu and virt-manager
2. download Windows 10 ISO straight from Microsoft
3. install  ~acpica-tools~ and acquire product key
4. install Windows 10 in VM

This has the added benefit that I now have an up-to-date install of Windows 10 without any bloatware.

I am a firm believer in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle][Pareto Principle]] which states that in many cases 80% of the result is achieved by 20% of the effort, and, consequently, that the remaining 20% of the result takes 80% of the effort. This means, if you can live with 80% of the result, you are 16 times more efficient than when you insist on the 100%.

The chief of the World Food Programme (WFP) [[https://insight.wfp.org/wfp-chief-warns-of-hunger-pandemic-as-global-food-crises-report-launched-3ee3edb38e47][warned]] the UN Security Council that in a few months the world might face ‚Äúmultiple famines of biblical proportions‚Äù from the economic impact of COVID-19 that could result in 300,000 deaths /per day/ over a three-month period. That's the same amount of victims /per day/ as COVID-19 has taken so far /in total/!

I think this calls for us to stop our [[/covid19-whats-the-point][100% ambition]] and start applying the Pareto principle. But what would the 20% effort be to contain COVID-19? I think it is this (but remember: /I am no expert/):

1. _Mind your hygiene_:
   - wash you hands regularly and thoroughly
   - sneeze in your elbow
2. _Stay at home_ when you may contaminate others, including:
   - when you have been tested positive
   - when you have symptoms
   - when you have been in contact with someone you know belongs to one of the above
3. _Avoid busy places_, which means
   - places where you are consistently or frequently within 1.5 meters from people you don't know intimately (think bars, churches, gyms)
4. If you can't avoid a busy place, _wear a face mask_ there.
   - think public transport
   - think professions like hair dressers, waiters, physiotherapists, etc.

[[/keep-calm-corona.jpg]]

Additional remarks:
- The rule to stay at home applies to all contagious illnesses, including but not limited to the common flu. No more toughing it out: stay at home! I think this rule and the hygiene rule are sensible rules even without Corona.
- The 1.5 meter criterion is no longer a rule by itself, but becomes a rule of thumb for the rule to avoid busy places. This enables us to relax a little. Don't worry too much when you occasionally and briefly get within 1.5 meters of other customers in the supermarket. Viruses don't fly and don't jump.
- The face mask is not intended to protect you from others, it is meant to protect others from you.

These rules allow some wiggle room. That is intentional. When you are extra vulnerable to this virus, for example because of your age or because of an existing condition, you can apply the rules more strictly. Others can be a bit more relaxed. This way I hope we can get maximum effectiveness with minimal collateral damage.

And remember, the current measures against COVID-19 /are/ doing a lot of damage. The billions we spend/loose now will have consequences for years and maybe even decades to come. This will mean less budget for health, education, social services, and foreign aid. This will hit the vulnerable the hardest, including the elderly, the poor, and the ill, which are exactly those we intend to protect from Corona now.

Yesterday, our prime minister told us to [[https://nos.nl/liveblog/2331161-nog-geen-contactberoepen-of-bezoek-aan-verpleeghuizen-basisscholen-11-mei-open.html][keep it up]]. The current corona measures in The Netherlands are extended for weeks and months. The policy makes perfect sense.

Except that it doesn't. To me.

To me it felt like our government is working from a different set of rules than I would. And that made me wonder what their basic principle is. The official line is the policy aims to reduce the pressure on our healthcare system, and the intensive care in particular. But I think it is this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We must prevent that people contract COVID19 at all cost and provide COVID19 patients with the absolute best medical care.
#+END_QUOTE

Notice the "at all cost". We spend/loose [[https://nos.nl/artikel/2331159-grote-pensioenfondsen-diep-onder-water-77-miljard-verdampt.html][billions]] to save COVID19 patients. Including [[https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5092456/corona-verpleeghuizen-ouderen-besmet][many]] elderly in nursing homes where the average live expectancy is [[https://www.zorgvisie.nl/sterftecijfer-verpleeghuis-stijgt-met-kwart/][less than a year]]. Many of those are suffering from dementia, and especially for them, the lockdown is [[https://www.medischcontact.nl/opinie/lezers-schrijven/lezersverhalen/lezersverhaal/als-ook-zwaaien-niet-meer-mag.htm][hell]]. Wouldn't it be more humane to make their last months as pleasant as possible, instead of extending their lives with a couple of miserable, unhappy months? I am not suggesting we should scrimp on medical care, but I can't help but feel we could spend this money more wisely (e.g. on care for other patients, on education, or on saving the environment).

Notice this statement is about medical care only. Not about economy, mental health, or happiness. Yesterday our prime minister said "National health is more important than the economy". Who wouldn't agree? Except, we're /not/ talking about national health. We are talking about personal tragedies like loosing your mother, grandfather or partner. The current number of casualties (3916) is less than 3% of the total number of 150.000 yearly deaths in the Netherlands. That would leave COVID19 on tenth place in the [[https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/ranglijst/ranglijst-doodsoorzaken-op-basis-van-sterfte][ranking]] of causes of death. Less than a quarter of dementia, and less than half of lung cancer, stroke and heart diseases (each). And we don't consider those "crises". At least, we don't lock down our whole society to fight them. We don't even ban cigarettes, soft drinks, and fast food.

Notice this is about COVID19 patients only. The care for all other patients has been reduced or even suspended. But why would their care be less important and less urgent?

Notice this is about "absolute best" medical care. We are told the situation on ICs is like a war zone. But when someone suggest one breathing apparatus can be used for multiple patients, this is [[https://nos.nl/artikel/2328509-twee-ic-patienten-op-een-beademingsapparaat-extreem-terughoudend-mee-zijn.html][suboptimal]] and only for [[https://zorgnu.avrotros.nl/nieuws/item/in-uiterst-geval-meerdere-patienten-aan-een-beademingsapparaat/][extreme cases]]. 600.000 face masks delivered from China were [[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/262896058/600-000-mondkapjes-uit-china-afgekeurd-door-ministerie][rejected]] because they did not stand up to our medical standards. So, although we are in a crisis, apparently it is not bad enough yet that we are happy with any help we can get and try to make do with what we've got.

Notice this is a doctor's objective. Which in itself is fine; it is what they are trained and paid for. But it is not about what patients want or what society wants. I feel like we need a more balanced approach.

Notice the word "must". To quote our prime minister yesterday: "The freedom of one, may not harm the health of others". I assume he meant "freedom to go to bars/parks/churches" and not "civil rights", but we have already sacrificed our freedom of movement and our privacy, so statements like this scare me. Apparently this principle is above any discussion and worth sacrificing civil rights for.

Finally, let me say this. One thing I /did/ agree with in the prime minister's speech yesterday was his appreciation of the healthcare providers. We ask a lot of them in the area's that have been hit hard by the Corona virus, both in terms of workload and mental strain. But I don't [[https://www.ad.nl/home/applaus-voor-onze-helden-van-de-zorg~aeba83ee/][applaud]] or wave a [[https://www.persberichten.com/persbericht/97544/Vlag-voor-de-Zorg-steun-onze-zorgbranche-in-tijden-van-crisis-en-wereldwijde-coronaprojecten][flag]]. As recent as November, 2019 we had the [[https://www.hartvannederland.nl/nieuws/2019/grootste-staking-ziekenhuizen-ooit/][biggest hospital strike ever]]. Nurses asked for higher pay and lower workload, but as far as I know, they never got them. But right in the middle of the Corona crisis, we are [[https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl/economie/1696986/klm-wil-2-miljard-steun-en-een-hoger-salaris-voor-de-directeur.html][discussing]] an /extra/ bonus for the CEO of the KLM, which is also asking for state support to stay in business. Let's applaud mr. Elbers and raise a flag for him if we have to, but save our money for the nurses!

PS1: Fortunately, after pressure from the government and the public, KLM have [[https://nieuws.klm.com/geen-voorgestelde-aanpassing-beloningsbeleid-klm/][cancelled]] raises and bonuses of the CEO in 2020.

PS2: In my [[covid-19-end-game][previous post]] I have indicated what I think we /should/ do.

We have been in Corona-lockdown for about 5 weeks now, here in the Netherlands. As we are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel, it is time to start thinking on how we can get out of it.

** Disclaimer

I am no expert by any means. The views below are just my personal dribble. Follow the [[https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/veelgestelde-vragen-over-de-aanpak-van-het-nieuwe-coronavirus-in-nederland][official guidelines]] of your government. I know I do. Better to be safe than sorry.

** My view

- The virus [[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html][spreads]] person-to-person through respiratory droplets, mostly by air (e.g. through sneezing, singing or shouting), and much less through objects we touch.
- Almost all casualties are over 50 with the median around 83, and about half had an underlying condition. But I think it is patronizing and inhumane to isolate the elderly and the vulnerable in times when they are in desperate need of human contact.
- Closing schools is highly disruptive to our society. It drives children and parents insane, and keeps adults away from their jobs. And infected children almost never develop any serious symptoms, so they hardly ever sneeze, so they hardly ever contaminate others.
- The pandemic seems to be highly regional (Lombardy, New York, the south of The Netherlands).
- I am [[covid-19][still]] not convinced that COVID-19 is significantly worse than the common flu. What I think we /can/ all agree on, is that COVID-19 is /new/, which means nobody had any immunity against it. I can't help but wonder if that is sufficient to explain the current pandemic.

** What I think we should do

This is going to take longer than anyone of us will be comfortable with. The IC personel can't keep this up for more than a couple of months, locked-up people go mad, and we need to have a healthy economy to pay for all this. I fear that in a couple of weeks the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLu07aXTEKY][holier than thou]] types and the /this doesn't concern me/ types will have grown so far apart, that conflicts become inevitable. So, our society needs to get back to normal soon, and we need to find other ways than a lock-down to deal with this pandemic:

- We should /not/ sacrifice our civil rights. They are more important than the stress on ICs, the economy, or anyone we are trying to save from COVID-19.
- We should relax a bit about the 1.5m rule. We should avoid situations where we are packed together over longer periods of time (like in movie theaters), where we sing and shout (like churches and bars), and/or with bad ventilation (like saunas and festival tents). So, we /should/ keep the ban on gatherings, but we shouldn't worry too much if we pass each other in parks or super market aisles.
- We should stay at home if we have any symptoms or suspicions (like contact with someone with symptoms), but we should get back to work otherwise. Be smart about it: work from home if you can, not too many people in one room (use video-conferencing), avoid physical contact.
- We should keep quarantining known and suspected cases.
- We should customize our approach per region. I live in the [[https://www.dvhn.nl/groningen/Experts-Misschien-kan-het-Noorden-wel-eerder-uit-de-lockdown-dan-de-rest-van-Nederland-25564568.html][north]] of The Netherlands, where we have only a few casualties, while in the south it runs in the thousands. Solidarity is important, but nobody gains from killing the economy here, to solve a problem elsewhere.
- We should enable and support elderly (and other vulnerable population groups) if they want to self-isolate. But if they don't, we should also allow contact with their loved ones. I suspect this is hard to execute (what with dementia, what with conflicting wishes in nursing homes, etc.), but we should at least /try/ to give them control over their own lives.
- We should open schools again, except perhaps in highly contaminated regions.
- We should stop obsessing about daily numbers. They are meaningless. And although statistics (not the same as daily body counts in bold headlines) are a powerful tool, if I have learned anything from my college classes, it is that /statistics are tricky/. So, remember: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics][lies, damn lies, and statistics]].

In some ways the COVID-19 pandemic reminds me of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem][Y2K bug]]. I remember in the late 1990s there was a lot of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt][FUD]] regarding the millennium bug. If we didn't act, civilization as we knew it would end. Public facilities, like communications, electricity and water, would grind to a halt and crucial databases would be lost. Major efforts were undertaken to remedy the problem and prevent this fatal melt-down.

Come January 1, 2000 nothing happened.

I still feel dissatisfied at the fact that I don't know if nothing happened because the problem had been tackled so effectively, or because the problem wasn't so big to begin with. I also remember the impression I had that the parties that boosted the scare were the same parties that stood to profit massively from its solution.

I fear something similar will happen now that COVID-19 is turning out to be not such a big thing in the part of The Netherlands where I live and is starting to get under control in the hotspots around the world. Are we starting to see the effect of the measures that have been taken, or would the virus have blown over anyway? I feel like it is a bit of both: it is a nasty virus that we should take seriously and try to control with reasonable measures, but not as apocalyptic as in the [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114069/][movie]] or the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11989.The_Plague][book]].

A big difference with Y2K is that COVID-19 will be a recurring phenomenon. If we get too lax a about it, it may get back at us with a vengeance.

In my previous post on [[covid-19][COVID-19]] I predicted that mid April we would be past the worst in the Netherlands. This post is an update.

[[https://www.tweedekamer.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/20200325_briefing_coronavirus_tweede_kamer_presentatie_rivm.pdf][Last week]] [25 March, Dutch] the Dutch [[https://www.rivm.nl/en][National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] gave the first careful signals that things were getting better: the daily growth of new patients was slowing down. In other words: the reproduction number /R0/ was moving below 1.0. [[https://www.tweedekamer.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/powerpoint_rivm_1_april_2020.pdf][This  week]] [April 1, Dutch] this trend was confirmed and more positive developments were starting to show. But the message is still: We need to keep doing what we're doing.

The [[https://www.tweedekamer.nl/sites/default/files/atoms/files/tech_briefing_1_apr_2020_gommers.pdf][message]] from the [[https://nvic.nl/][Dutch Association for Intensive Care]] was less optimistic: they were expecting to need 2500 IC beds by the end of May.

[[https://nos.nl/data/image/2020/04/04/641321/1280x720a.jpg]]
The most telling statistics at this point to me are that today's [[https://nos.nl/artikel/2329478-de-coronacijfers-van-5-april-nieuwe-ziekenhuisopnames-laagste-in-twee-weken.html][number of new hospital admissions]] was the lowest in two weeks and the peek was on March 31. Also, in Belgium [[https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-rivm-115-nieuwe-sterfgevallen-drukte-in-natuur-lijkt-opnieuw-mee-te-vallen#UPDATE-container-44494253][today]] more corona-patients left the hospital than entered (granted, Belgium is not Holland, but still). [[https://nos.nl/artikel/2329389-de-coronacijfers-van-4-april-minder-nieuwe-ziekenhuis-en-ic-opnames.html][Yesterday's]] statistics already show the growth of IC admissions slowing down. With this trend it would seem that the current capacity of 1900 will be more than sufficient, and the feared 2500 seem unlikely. The latest [[https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-instroom-op-intensive-care-vlakt-af-doelstelling-ic-bedden-gehaald][news]] from the national coordination centre seems to confirm this.

So, the question is when and how will we turn from [[https://www.nd.nl/nieuws/varia/961390/rutte-grootste-crisis-in-vredestijd-sinds-woii][this is the biggest disaster since WWII]] to "let's be reasonable about this". Politicians and policy makers cannot change their minds, without serious repercussions for their credibility and careers. Also, sudden changes in policy may lead to social unrest. So, this needs to be spinned carefully.

I think the /when/ cannot be far away, because the [[ https://www.lastampa.it/cronaca/2020/04/03/news/esce-il-sole-strade-e-piazze-affollate-con-la-scusa-della-spesa-1.38674825][situation]] in Italy shows there's an end to how long people will endure a lock-down. So I expect the coming two weeks the pressure will rise. For example, when it becomes clear that hundreds of IC-beds are remaining empty. Gradually, more [[https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2329144-sterftecijfers-moeten-die-elke-dag-zo-expliciet-in-het-nieuws.html][critical]] messages will become more acceptable and more main stream. The media will more and more start to question the wisdom of the current lock-down. But it is not politically viable to change tack before the end of the current measures on April 28.

The /how/ is trickier, but I expect the tone will be "now we've brought COVID-19 successfully under control, we need to turn our attention to the economy". Look at [[https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-instroom-op-intensive-care-vlakt-af-doelstelling-ic-bedden-gehaald][how]] the possible over-capacity of IC beds is presented: "target achieved". I expect the common sense measures (wash you hands, reduce social contacts) will remain in place for some time, but the economy-killing measures like closing schools and the catering and entertainment industries will be reduced gradually by the end of the month. The [[https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/politiek/artikel/5081496/ondernemersvoorman-meivakantie-hans-de-boer-vno-ncw-corona-gas][first signs]] are already there by the call of the Dutch entrepreneurs association [[https://www.vno-ncw.nl/][VNO-NCW]] to speed up after the May holidays.

* PUBLISHED How I work from home                               :productivity:
CLOSED: [2020-03-25 wo 10:03]
During this COVID-19 pandemic many people are forced to work at home. Not by choice, but by necessity. For many of us, this is new territory, for some of us it isn't.

I have been working from home for 15+ years. In this post I share how I make that work.

** My typical work day

The rest of this post I will try to keep as general as possible, but the tips below are inspired by my personal situation. So, it helps if you know what that situation is like:
- I am a software engineer. Working for me means responding to email and phone calls, writing documents, and coding. That means the most specific tools I need are a desk and a more than decent computer.
- We have kids at home between the ages of 14 and 20.
- A couple of times a week I have meetings with customers. Usually at their premises.

** Demand your own space

Nothing kills my productivity like regular interrupts from other members of our household. My daughter comes for a hug, my spouse comes to discuss diner plans, other kids come to share the latest news, and on, and on, and on. All of them valid reasons to ask my attention, but it requires me to switch context a couple of times an hour if I let it go.

So, I taught my kids that even though I am at home, I really am at work. Just like other parents cannot be disturbed at their office, I cannot be disturbed at mine.

Of course, this doesn't work. They can see me sitting there, so I /must/ be available. So, I get grumpy and tell them "if it doesn't bleed, I don't need to know". This may sound harsh, but for me it's the only way to get work done.

This is getting easier now the kids are getting older. They better understand the concepts of focus and distraction. They better understand that my work pays their bills. With younger kids this is harder, especially in these strange and disturbing times. They need and deserve more attention from their parents than usual. But if you want to get work done, demand to be left alone at least some of the time.

** Take a break

I learned the hard way that working without regular breaks is bad for me. RSI in my neck and shoulder have hampered my productivity for years. So these days I work in 45 minutes intervals. At first I needed a timer (I used [[http://www.workrave.org/][Workrave]]) but by now my internal clock reminds me to take a break. And if I ignore that, my neck and shoulder will remind me.

During those breaks, I eat a snack, walk the dog, clean the kitchen counter top, go for a jog, put the laundry in the dryer, buy groceries, or just watch TV. You would think these breaks would be a good time to talk with the kids (they certainly think so), but to me that is /not/ time off. It doesn't let me relax.

In my case, a /break/ is meant to turn off my brain for a moment. So, exercise is great, and simple chores and mindless entertainment also work. But when your work is more physical in nature, this may be just the other way around. Find out what works for you, but relax at regular intervals.

** Reduce distractions

Apart from distraction by members of our household, there are many other distractions. As my work is digital by nature, I am online all the time. And, as you know (because you are reading this), the web is a quagmire of distractions, with websites specifically designed to lure you in.

So, I use separate browser windows: one for private email, one for business email, and one for actual work. The first two are minimized most of the time (actually, they are in a separate [[https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-workspaces.html.en][workspace]]), and I have developed the habit to keep them that way. I only check my email two or three times a day and use the [[https://www.process.st/inbox-zero/][Inbox Zero]] approach. This means I handle each incoming email as follows:
1. Delete if not relevant
2. Do now if it is done within two minutes
3. Defer by putting it in your [[What is Org mode][task management]] if it needs more time
4. Delegate if somebody else can do it better
5. Respond (this I always do when appropriate, if only to let them know their message was received)
After steps 2 though 5 I archive the email, so my inbox is almost always mostly empty.

Finally, I have adopted the habit to only read social media and news feeds on my tablet. That tablet is in our living room, so social media and news feeds do not distract me when I am working at my desk. I read those during my breaks, but mostly during the evening.

I am aware that most of these strategies depend on self-discipline and developing habits, but I am afraid that's a fact of life when your working at home.

** Keep a regular schedule

Every morning I get up with my spouse. When she leaves for the office, I start work too (and save 40 minutes commute time twice a day). Around noon I have my lunch break. And I start cooking diner around 5 p.m. This regular schedule helps me to get in the 'work mood' and to switch it off again at the end of the day.

And don't underestimate the importance of the latter. You may tempted to think that all that time you spent during the day on chores, breaks, your kids and online news must be compensated in the evening, but that is not true. I find I am way more productive at home than I ever was in the office, with distracting managers, meaningless meetings that drag on forever, small-talk at the coffee machine, and so on. Don't get me wrong, just like the distractions at home, these are important elements of the social fabric that build communities, but they /do/ keep you from being productive /now/.

Just as office workers you should adopt the OA5 strategy (/Out at 5/ from chapter 26 of [[https://thegistyoumissed.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/the-dilbert-principle-by-scott-adams/][The Dilbert Principle]]).

** Use available tools

I use the following tools (usually on [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]]) for remote cooperation, in order of frequency:
- [[What is Org mode][Org mode]] for task management
- email (GMail in my case) for communication with customers
- Whatsapp for private communication (I try to keep business communication away from Whatsapp, but that doesn't always work)
- [[https://github.com/otech-nl][Github]] for version management, issue management, and code sharing
- my [[https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-x4-android-one/p][phone]]
- [[https://docs.google.com/][Google docs]] for documents
- [[https://www.skype.com/][Skype]] for conference calls, mainly because of its feature that let's you share you desktop with others
- [[https://slack.com/][Slack]] for groups
- [[https://www.teamviewer.com/][TeamViewer]] and [[https://remmina.org/][Remmina]] for remote access (only occasionally)

Just like everybody else COVID-19 is on my mind constantly these days. In this post I look at what is going on according to main stream media, what other views experts may have, and I try to figure out what is happening.

I am not an expert: I am not a virologist, nor a data scientist. So, my intention is to rely on those who are. But between them and me are the media, politics and public opinion, which may obscure my view if I am not careful. So, let's dig in.

** First
My heart goes out to all the victims of this virus. I wish strength to those who are sick, those who have lost or fear the loss of a loved one, and the care-givers who are working hard to help them. You deserve our support!

** What we hear in the news
These [[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/12/21172040/coronavirus-covid-19-virus-charts][11 charts]] [March 17] nicely summarize the data we see in the news every day. The gist:
- the virus is spreading rapidly
- this is much more severe than the ordinary flu:
|                        | Seasonal Flu | COVID-19 |
|------------------------+--------------+--------|
| infection rate ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number][R0]])    |          1.3 |    2.3 |
| incubation time (days) |          1-4 |   1-14 |
| hospitalization rate   |           2% |    19% |
| death rate             |         0.1% |   3.4% |
- people dying of COVID-19 are almost all more that 60 years old and often have pre-existing conditions
- there are significant differences between the testing strategies of each country, ranging from 23 per million people in the US to 3,692 per million people in South Korea
- Flattening the Curve by Social Distancing currently is the best strategy to contain the virus

In his [[https://www.elysee.fr/emmanuel-macron/2020/03/16/adresse-aux-francais-covid19][address]] [March 16, French] to the nation the French President Emmanual Macron said: "We are at war, in a health war, of course: we are not fighting against an army or against another Nation. But the enemy is there, invisible, elusive, advancing. And that requires our general mobilization."

If statements like this don't strike fear in the hearts of citizens, nothing will...

** But...

In [[https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/17/a-fiasco-in-the-making-as-the-coronavirus-pandemic-takes-hold-we-are-making-decisions-without-reliable-data/][STAT news]] [March 17], John P.A. Ioannidis of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford ([[https://metrics.stanford.edu/][METRICS]]), comes with some provoking statements:
- The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable.
- Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror ‚Äî and are meaningless.
- If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction][PCR tests]], the number of total deaths due to ‚Äúinfluenza-like illness‚Äù would not seem unusual this year.
- Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries. In the coronavirus pandemic, we're making decisions without reliable data
- If the level of the epidemic does overwhelm the health system and extreme measures have only modest effectiveness, then flattening the curve may make things worse: Instead of being overwhelmed during a short, acute phase, the health system will remain overwhelmed for a more protracted period.

This prompted me to see if I could find out more.

*** How bad is COVID-19, really?

The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated by the WHO to be 3.4%, based on numbers from Wuhan. But newer [[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html][reports]] [March 20] suggest the number was much lower there, more like 1.4%.

The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) of the University of Oxford [[https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/][explains]] that the /Infection Rate Fatality/ (IFR) differs from the /Case Fatality  Rate/ (CFR) in that it aims to estimate the fatality rate in /all/ those with infection: the patients who have been tested positive (cases) and those with an undetected disease (asymptomatic and not tested group). "Our current best assumption, as of the 22nd March, is the IFR  is approximate 0.19%." What this means is clearly visible in [[https://www.ft.com/content/c0755b30-69bb-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3][Germany]] where 24,873 people have been tested positive and 94 have died (0.4%): the point here is that Germany performs 160,000 COVID-19 tests every week which means they find far more infections than any other country, but their fatality rate is much lower.

Ioannidis refers to the [[https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/diamond-princess-update.html][Diamond Princess Cruise Ship]] as one situation where an entire, closed population was tested (six deaths occurred out of 705 who tested positive constituting a CFR of 0.85%. All six deaths six occurred in patients > 70. No one under 70 died): "Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%." (the article continues with further nuances). This is confirmed by this [[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773v2][study]]: comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, they estimated CFR 1.1% and IFR 0.5%.

To put things in perspective, the seasonal flu in the Netherlands (17 million people) cost 9,500 deaths in [[https://www.snpg.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-RIVM-Griep-in-beeld-winter-2017-18.pdf][season 2017/2018]] [Dutch] and hardly anybody noticed. Compare this to the 179 deaths from COVID-19 in The Netherlands now (March 22), or the 5476 deaths in Italy ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy][Lombardy]] has 10 million inhabitants) and the 3275 deaths in China ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan][Wuhan]] has 11 million). The season 2017/2018 was a severe flu season in The Netherlands but [[https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/onderwerp/influenza/cijfers-context/sterfte][other seasons]] [Dutch] still show significant numbers.

We have had similar outbreaks of viruses in the past, like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic][2009/2010 swine or Mexican flu pandamic]] with estimates of 700 million-1.4 billion confirmed cases and 151,700-575,400 deaths. These are staggering numbers, but in The Journal of the American Medical Association as early as Sept 8 2010 Edward A. Belongia and colleagues [[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/186549][report]] numbers that suggest that the swine flu were no worse than the seasonal flu. The WHO [[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-flu-who/world-must-prepare-for-inevitable-next-flu-pandemic-who-says-idUSKBN1QS1EP][confirmed]] in 2019 that swine flu ended up with a fatality rate of 0.02%. And this pandemic also saw the Mexican government closing most of Mexico city and clinics in some areas being overwhelmed by infected people.

CEBM conclude that evaluating CFR during a pandemic is a hazardous exercise, and high-end estimates must be treated with caution as the H1N1 pandemic highlights that original estimates were off by a factor greater than 10.

*** How effective is the current strategy?

/Flatten the curve/ and /Social Distancing/ are the current strategies of choice. CEBM [[https://www.cebm.net/what-is-the-evidence-for-social-distancing-during-global-pandemics-a-rapid-summary-of-current-knowledge/][states]]: "Although limited, the best available evidence appears to support social distancing measures as a means of reducing transmission and delaying spread. Staggered and cumulative implementation of these interventions may prove most effective. The timing and duration of such measures is critical." but [[https://www.cebm.net/what-is-the-evidence-for-mass-gatherings-during-global-pandemics/][also]]: "The effect of restricting and cancelling mass gatherings and sporting events on infectious diseases is poorly established and requires further assessment. The best-available evidence suggests multiple-day events with crowded communal accommodations are most associated with increased risk. Mass gatherings are not homogenous and risk should be assessed on a case-by-case basis."

*** Where is this going?

Michael Levitt, an American-British-Israeli biophysicist who won the 2013 Nobel prize for chemistry has [[https://m.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Israeli-nobel-laureate-Coronavirus-spread-is-slowing-621145][monitored]] [March 20] the virus in China since the early days. He predicted the current decline in number of infections two weeks before it happened and now predicts the virus will disappear from China by the end of March. This [[http://www.casperalbers.nl/nl/post/2020-03-11-coronagrafieken/][explanation]] [March 11, Dutch] by Applied Statistics professor Casper Albers shows why the exponential model to predict new cases doesn't fit the data, but that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression][logistic regression]] does and probably provides a better model.

Notice the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number][definition]] of the infection rate /R0/:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.
#+END_QUOTE
The key words here are "susceptible to infection". Of course, in time not all individuals will be susceptible to infection anymore and the virus will die out. And the more contagious a virus is, the sooner this will happen.

The social media bombard us with cries of panic and pleas for help from doctors and nurses from Italy, but we also get [[https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/26/news/coronavirus_la_virologa_gismondo_e_le_notti_in_laboratorio_contro_la_psicosi_basta_la_verita_ora_tanti_mi_stanno_dando_ra-249593378/?refresh_ce][this interview]] [Feb 26, Italian] with Maria Rita Gismondo, the director of the [[https://www.asst-fbf-sacco.it/reparti-e-servizi/info/microbiologia-clinica-virologia-e-diagnostica-bioemergenze][Laboratory]] of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and bio-emergencies in Milan, who states "There is a bombardment of news that foment fear, there has been a collective brainwashing", but COVID-19 "is little more than a normal flu", and "we are /not/ at war". For this, Gismondo has received [[https://www.repubblica.it/salute/medicina-e-ricerca/2020/03/22/news/coronavirus_lopalco_diffida_gismondo_per_difendere_cittadini_e_scienza_-251984326/][serious flack]] [22 March, Italian] but that hasn't changed her mind.

** What's going on here?

Current data cannot tell us yet how bad COVID-19 actually is. It may be bad, but it may also be comparable to the common flu. We just don't know yet.

That makes we wonder why the response is so strong and why COVID-19 has lead to draconian measures like totally locking down entire countries. I can come up with a number of possible explanations:

*** COVID-19 may actually be worse

From the looks of it, I get the impression that COVID-19 is /fast/. The numbers may be similar to those of the common flu, but they are achieved in weeks instead of months. That pushes us to also /respond/ fast. Don't think, act!

*** FUD

In marketing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt][FUD]], for /Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt/, is a well-known strategy. It pushes people towards the perceived safer option.

These days we are used to big data giving immediate answers. We are used to be in control: when you're sick, go to the doctor. The doctor knows best.

So, when we see experts without answers and doctors panicking, we start to panic too, and flock to anyone who pretends to have a solution.

*** Social media

Even during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, social media were not as ubiquitous as they are today. Back then we got updates a couple of times a day, mostly text, sometimes with a photo. These days we get updates almost live and with video. That has a significantly different impact by instilling a constant sense of urgency.

If we got similarly frequent updates about the common flu during flu season, we might respond as we do now. In fact, [[http://flunewseurope.org/][similar maps]] exist, but probably don't get the same amount of traffic as those for COVID-19 ([[https://localfocus2.appspot.com/5e6f877460e13][this map]] shows the global numbers and [[https://localfocus2.appspot.com/5e68e7405456b][this map]] shows the Dutch situation).

Moreover, even more than in tradition news sources, on social media panic mongers get the same amount of screen time as experts, if not more. Experts are difficult, while demagogues provide snappy sound bites. We bother less and less with the longer, more complicated, but also more nuanced articles.

*** Sign of the times

I feel like we live in times where small vocal groups have a strong grip on the media and politicians.

In The Netherlands the official guide lines are:
- wash you hands and sneeze in the inside of your elbow
- keep 1.5 meters distance (so, don't shake hands)
- work at home if possible
- stay at home if you don't feel well (sneezing, coughing, fever)
- events with more than 100 attendees have been cancelled

Schools have been closed since March 16. Not because experts thought it necessary, but [[https://www.parool.nl/nederland/coronavirus-is-nachtmerrie-voor-kabinet-niemand-wil-een-lockdown~b2315da1/][because]] [Dutch] "society voted with their feet". In other words: the government had no other choice, because school leaders wanted to close and parents kept their kids at home.

Also, on social media people are shamed for visiting parks, letting their children play outside, and generally being social. Usually by [[https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/karen][Karens]] on Twitter, celebrities in talk shows or other non-experts. They seem to feel the need to 'educate' their fellow citizens and demonstrate their superior correctness.

But also local mayors and individual medical professionals feel the need to be stricter that the official guide-lines. They seem to think they know better than multi-disciplinary teams of experts that weighed the pros and cons of all options. As a software developer, I know that local optimization may have disastrous global side-effects.

** Conclusion

We just don't know yet, and anybody who suggest they do are lying.

My two cents, and remember I am no expert, so this is not much more than divination and is intended primarily for myself to look back and see where I was most wrong:
- I support the moderate approach chosen by the Dutch government (mind your hygiene and reduce your number of social contacts). It makes sense and won't hurt. But more draconian measures like total lock-downs may be less effective and more harmful than we think. Especially long-term.
- COVID-19 is a nasty, aggressive bug and I fear we're up for a couple of rough weeks. I hope that in The Netherlands by mid April the worst will be over and around May we will pretty much be back to normal. But I am known to be an optimist. I expect that next year COVID-19 will be part of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine][flu shot cocktail]].
- The economic ramifications may outlast the medical ones. The stock exchange is ruled by emotion and consumers will be cautious for a long time. In a couple of years we may conclude that over-reacting now has cost more than we thought possible, both in terms of lives as financially.

Most importantly: Let's keep calm and use our heads.

I don't usually do Microsoft Bashing, but this one was too good to let go.

On LinkedIn I saw an ad which read (translated):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Don't let IT get in the way of your growth.
#+END_QUOTE
Which sounds as sensible a plan as any.

But on second thought, this is a very modest objective. Shouldn't the point of IT be to /help/ me grow? And why only /growth/?

When I work on Windows it feels as if it is always in my way. When I want to start working, it needs to update (which too often fails if my PC is older than 18 months). If I receive a document from someone else, it is in a newer version of Word than mine (granted, I am the one who chooses to keep using an 'old' version of Word). When I want to run Docker, I need to upgrade to Windows Pro. Etc, etc.

So one of the main reasons I use Open Source Software is that I feel liberated. Also in the beer and speech sense, but in this case I mean in the 'wearing comfortable shoes' sense.

It updates in the background and never fails. Therefore, I always have the latest (or at least a recent) version of every tool I use. And I can use Docker (or any other tool) any way I want.

I have been using [[https://www.virtualbox.org/][VirtualBox]] for years to manage my virtual machines (including [[https://www.vagrantup.com][Vagrant]]). It always worked fine, but with over 150MB in size, it felt a little on the heavy side.

The post [[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609][The right to be rude]] by Eric Raymond struck a chord with me:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The habit of institutional tone policing, even when well-intentioned, too easily slides into the active censorship of disfavored views.
#+END_QUOTE

I feel the same way. Although for me the problem is not so much the /institutions/, but more the unchecked power of small, highly vocal interest groups, that set the tone. These groups manage to control the public debate to the extent that public figures (like politicians and talk show hosts) cannot afford to publicly disagree with them. Some topics have been made so sensitive, that they can no longer discuss them openly and freely, for fear of damaging their reputation.

Raymond puts it like this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The cost of a culture in which avoiding offense trumps the liberty to speak is that crybullies control the discourse.
#+END_QUOTE

However, there is no need to be "rude". We can politely and respectfully disagree, without offending or insulting each other. That's what I would /like/ to say, but I can't. Because some groups take offense so easily, that I feel it has become all but impossible to have a meaningful dialogue. It seems these groups think that shutting up their opponents by  smothering the public debate actually changes their minds. But this approach doesn't bring ideas closer together. Instead, it fosters frustration, prejudice and polarization.

I would like to live in a society that encourages the free exchange of ideas, where we accept and even respect viewpoints that differ from our own. This requires the possibility to safely disagree with each other.

I firmly believe that many differences of opinion are actually differences of perspective. To explain what I mean, the front cover of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach][G√∂del, Escher, Bach]] provides a perfect visualization.

We see three complex 3D wooden shapes that seemingly become simple 2D shapes when viewed from different angles. The viewers from the left see the letter E over G, the viewers from the right see the letter G over E, and the viewers from the top see the letter B.

Now envision all the discussions that will ensue. The viewers from the top are convinced there is Only One Letter (they could start a church), while the others will maintain there are two. The viewers from the left are sure the E is above the G, while the viewers from the right think it's the other way around, and the viewers from the top know for sure there is no G or E at all (in whatever order).

I think this abstract figure translates directly to reality. For example in a discussion between graphical designers, marketeers and software developers. More often than not, they actually agree, even though they embark on endless discussions.

* PUBLISHED Embedded Documents in Mongodb                          :mongo:js:
CLOSED: [2020-02-23 zo 17:23]

I have done many attempts to wrap my head around [[https://www.mongodb.com/][MongoDB]]. As I come from the traditional world of RDBMSs, this does not come naturally to me. But the more I work with Javascript, the more natural the step to Mongo becomes.

So far, my attempts to use Mongo failed, due to my inability to overcome the learning curve. In this post I will discuss one of my the biggest hurdles: embedded documents and many-to-many-relationships.

In the relational world I hardly ever work in the database directly. I almost always use an ORM like [[https://www.sqlalchemy.org/][SQLAlchemy]], [[https://sequelize.org/][Sequelize]], or [[https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent][Eloquent]]. In the past I worked on projects with [[https://www.meteor.com/][Meteor]] which uses Mongo as a backend and uses [[https://guide.meteor.com/collections.html#schemas][schemas]] to help manage your data. [[https://mongoosejs.com/][Mongoose]] provides similar functionality, which I like.

Documents in MongoDB are hierarchical by nature. They easily map to JSON and Javascript objects, which makes the match with Javascript so elegant. This means that 1:n relations are modeled by having nested documents.

For example, in my current project organisations have teams, which in turn have members. The organisations data would look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  [
    {
      name: "Universal Exports",
      teams: [
        {
          name: "development",
          members: [...]
        },
        {
          name: "marketing",
          members: [...]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "ACME",
      teams: [
        {
          name: "design",
          members: [...]
        },
        {
          name: "production",
          members: [...]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
#+END_SRC

Team members are the system's users. Each team has multiple members and every user can be member of multiple teams. This results in a many-to-many-relationship, which can no longer be modeled hierarchically. Instead of containing the user data itself, the members refer to the ids of the users and the users are in their own collection.

Similarly, I could have chosen to make teams a separate collection and have the =teams= field of the organisation refer to the team ids. But in that case, a embedded document is more natural as each team belongs to exactly one organisation. Making organisations and teams separate collections would have been the relational way, and then I should have stayed with Sequelize and Postgres.

I run into the limitations of my Mongo knowledge as I attempt to find the teams a user belongs to. I tried some queries in the Mongo client:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
db.organisations.find({teams: {members: ObjectId("5e5146d2b941b21ccea02c48")}})
// no response

db.organisations.find({"teams.members": ObjectId("5e5146d2b941b21ccea02c48")})
// gives the correct organisation, but includes all teams
#+END_SRC
So far, I haven't been able to figure out how to get the relavant teams only. So, I end up writing Javascript code instead of Mongo queries. Hopefully, I will be able to follow-up on this post soon with a solution.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f61ipx/is_it_worth_it/][This Reddit post]] dares to ask the question if Emacs is worth it. Quite courageous in the =r/emacs= subreddit, if you ask me...

What we get is some refreshingly blunt replies:
- Org Mode will mostly just cause you to waste your life configuring it. It will never end, always presenting another way to be more efficient/clever. One day you will find yourself sharing your story in an Orgaholics Anonymous meeting while gripping your paper notebook.
- I'm watching 10+ year old YouTube videos of Emacs presentations trying to find what possible configurations I've missed
- Emacs and Org present great temptations for procrastination when you need to get work done
- "I am learning to limit that because it was getting in the way of getting things done." leads to "Ah yes, the addiction at its finest."

It's all /so/ relatable. Here I am, writing a blog post I am not being paid for, while I have a long lists of tasks with actual deadlines. Org mode makes it into a /beautiful/ and /manageable/ list, true, but I am /not/ working on it.

Then [[https://www.reddit.com/user/publicvoit/][publicvoit]] nails it by:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Everybody is procrastinating. Anybody who disagrees is either lying or she/he is not aware of doing X as procrastinating.
The good news here is that you seem to optimize your working environment while procrastinating.
#+END_QUOTE

And that's also true. Fortunately. Better yet, when you automate some part of your workflow, you do not just make that task easier, but you also improve your automation skills. This means that next time you want to automate something, that too will be easier, and less of an obstacle to make further improvements.

My pitfall is that I am tempted to tinker. I tend to optimize and optimize my code (or my workflow), until it is just too clever. Just as the Reddit post above, [[https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/][this]] blog post is also very relatable. Fortunately, these days I am aware of this, and signal I am doing it again earlier. I once read the following advice, which I have been trying to follow ever since:

I think at the moment I have struck an acceptable balance. In the past I have been known to spend many hours making Emacs more beautiful. A thankless challenge in many ways, because Emacs is many things, but beautiful is not one of them. So currently, I experiment with packages that help me /now/ (as opposed to with some task in the future). Moreover, I try to stick with what's available out of the box and with the default configuration as much as possible.

A powerful tool like Emacs can be intimidating for beginners. But actually, Emacs is very beginner-friendly, because it comes standard with a plethora of help features. In this post, I'll give some starting points, and show what help functions I use the most.

First, just start up a vanilla Emacs (use =emacs -q= to bypass any user configuration files, if necessary) and the startup screen provides you with some helpful entry points, like the Emacs manual and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/][guided tour]]. Of course, you can find the same information, and much more, under the /Help/ menu item.

The manual that you can open from the startup screen teaches you some Emacs jargon, like how key bindings are defined. It provides an interactive introduction with exercises you can perform in the same buffer. It teaches you the Emacs-way to do things like navigate a document. To my taste its a bit dogmatic about that: I prefer arrow keys and PgUp/Dn to navigate, but the tutorial sticks to =C-v/M-v= and the likes.

The startup screen also contains a link to the Emacs manual, which introduces us to the wonderful world of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info-stnd/html_node/index.html][Info]]. We'll come back to that later, when we discuss the =C-h= key. For now, let's assume that Info is like the web: hypertext with links. So, open the manual and have a look around. What I like to do every now and then, is page though the documents by just pressing the space bar repeatedly. This is like leafing through a book and never fails to uncover gems I didn't know yet.

Section 1 "The Organization of the Screen" introduces much Emacs jargon that may put off beginners. This section explains words like /frame/, /window/, /buffer/, /point/, /mode line/ and /mini buffer/, all essential to be able to use all other information that is available to us.

Then, when you actually start to use Emacs, the menu bar provides access to most common commands, including the key bindings that go with them for commands you find you need most often. /Please/ resist the urge to install all those shiny third-party packages for now, and first dig through all the features that Emacs ships with out of the box, like searching, bookmarks, email and version control. Also have a look at all you can customize through the /Options/ menu. But again, /please/ stick with the defaults at first. They have been selected based on years of experience, and more often than not make more sense that you might think at first (promise!).

Finally, I you ever wonder /How do I do X?/ =C-h= is your friend:
- =C-h ?= shows all help command, including the ones I use most:
- =C-h a= (apropos) show commands matching a pattern
- =C-h k= describes a key
- =C-h f= describes a function (by default the function under point) and the keys associated with it
- =C-h v= describes a variable, its current value, its original value, and its possible values
- =C-h m= describes all currently active modes
- =C-h i= starts Info, which opens a whole library full of manuals, I don't believe you I will ever finish in this lifetime

Have fun exploring Emacs!

I distinguish between work and problems.

Work can be done by following well-known, accepted rules. It may not be easy, but you know from the start how hard it is and how much effort it takes. Work just takes time, energy and commitment. So, just do it already!

There are no predefined rules for problems. You have to figure them out as you go along. It's not even clear how to know which solution is best, because problems usually have multiple perspectives with (possibly conflicting) interests. Problems may even have multiple stakeholders. So you have to analyze the problem to come up with possible solutions, evaluate the solutions by all different criteria, and than choose on basis of incomplete information. And that's all /before/ you can start actually solving the problem itself.

The obvious trap here is that you can get stuck in the analysis/evaluation, because choosing is hard and often involves conflict. So my approach often is to just choose one option, fix the problem and deal with the consequences. Which may require me to get back to the drawing board to come up with a whole new solution. I am happy to solve a problem more than once, because it means you always have a solution in place (as imperfect as it may be), and it will gradually get better.

Email has become the core of corporate (and often private) communication. Most of us use it all day every day.

There used to be a time, where you downloaded your email and read it locally. But these days, email lives on a server somewhere. Which is A Good Thing, because we are mobile and this lets us read our email everywhere (which, in itself, is a mixed blessing at best).

But there's a downside: We now depend on the service providers. When their service is down, or we are off-line (the horror!) we don't have access to our email anymore. Or worse, if our provider goes out of business or just decides to discontinue its service, we may even loose our email permanently.

Fortunately, the solution is easy: back up your email. On Linux the most mentioned solutions are [[http://www.offlineimap.org/][offlineimap]] and [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][mbsync]]. A little research shows many people choosing mbsync over offlineimap, so I decided to follow suit. With the help of [[http://fengxia.co.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mbsync%20mu4e%20email.html][this]] and [[https://ryanwhittingham.com/using-multiple-email-accounts-with-mu4e/][this]] post I had it set up without too many problems.

Then I watched over 20k (almost 10 years worth) of my emails being pulled in, which comes to almost 6GB. It's now all save and cosy on my local hard drive. Synchronizing takes just seconds and I can still also access my email in the cloud from my smart phone and tablet.

As a bonus, and not entirely by accident, I can now read my email in Emacs using [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]]. But that's for another post.

* PUBLISHED What is Org mode                                            :org:

So I wrote about how to [[10 minute org mode 101][use]] Org mode, but only briefly discussed what it /is/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org mode is a fast and effective tool to manage personal information, like notes, tasks, and references. It is also used for authoring and publishing blogs, books and academic papers. Org mode is part of Emacs and stores its data in plain-text files.
#+END_QUOTE

That's not a lie, but it barely scratches the surface. I was listening to [[https://emacscast.org/episode_3/][Emacscast]] today, and the explanation by host Rakhim inspired this post.

Basically, I see Org mode as three parts:

- a markup language :: The markup language supports structuring with nested sections and formatting like for example Markdown. Unlike Markdown, and more like XML, org mode also supports meta data, like categories, tags, and properties
- an editor :: Org mode is part of Emacs, so when editing org mode, you can use all functions that Emacs provides. But it adds powerful features to manage complexity, like outlining, navigating, folding and tables.
- modules :: Org mode provides a myriad of modules out of the box, including, but definitely not limited to:
  - todos: Keep your task list with todo states, priorities, deadlines and scheduling.
  - agenda: Manage your tasks by sorting and filtering them in any way you can think of.
  - spreadsheet: Interactively calculate values in a table.
  - publish: Edit your content in org mode, and publish it as Markdown, HTML, PDF or EPUB out of the box, or [[https://github.com/kawabata/ox-pandoc][any other form]] via Pandoc.
  - literate programming: Execute code right in your document with Babel.
  - capture thoughts: With minimal disruption to your workflow.
  - time management: Estimate, register and report how you spend uour time.

As the markup is just plain text, you can edit org mode files in any text editor you like. This ensures you never loose access to your data. The editor is where org mode begins to distinguish itself: editors like [[https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode][VSCode]], [[https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode][Vim]] and [[https://packagecontrol.io/packages/orgmode][Sublime]] support only a small subset of the features you get when editing org mode in Emacs. But the modules are where org mode really starts to shine. They add such amazingly powerful features that they make org mode unlike any other tool I know.

The strength of these modules is that they are +integrated+ loosely coupled. By that I mean they have maximum cohesion and minimum dependency. And by that I mean that the modules form a suite where every tool works together with the others, but the do not /need/ each other. This way you can gradually add modules to get an ever richer experience and truly [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Organize Your Life In Plain Text!]]

* PUBLISHED Peter Principle for assholes                       :organisation:
CLOSED: [2020-02-06 do 08:38]

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle][Peter Principle]] states:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence"
#+END_QUOTE

It boils down to this: when you are competent at your job, you are promoted until you're /not/ competent anymore.

But I think something more sinister is at play here. In [[http://www.dilbert.com/][The Dilbert Principle]] Scott Adams suggests that the main task of management is to "Eliminate the Assholes". However, my view is that management /are/ the assholes. Nothing personal, so let me explain.

We are all constantly working for (1) our own position and (2) the higher good. Working for our own position may mean making our work as enjoyable as possible, maximizing status/income/power, or anything that you want to achieve for yourself. The higher good is the reason your job exists in the first place: the business of your customers, some political ideal, or a charity.

Most people most of the time look for a middle ground between their own position and the higher good. They try to strike a balance where the one not does not harm the other. But sometimes this doesn't work and you have to make a choice. For example, if you stand up for an important but unpopular policy, it may help the higher good, but it may harm your position.

This also works in unexpected ways. For example, if you work late to provide a critical feature for your client before its deadline, you would think this would help both the higher good and your position. But the latter is rarely the case. We are often not rewarded for extra effort we put in. Why is this?

I think this is because some people do /not/ balance their own position and the higher good, but instead choose just one of these. In particular, some people focus exclusively on their own position, and work for their own promotion only. So in the contest for income, status or power, these people win from anyone who divide their focus between their position and the higher good.

It is just as in sports: to really make it to the top, you have to sacrifice everything and everyone and put all your effort into becoming the best you can be at your chosen sport. This doesn't mean success is guaranteed if you do that (in fact, chances are remote), because others who do the same may have more talent. But it /does/ mean you will be more successful than people with similar talent who do not dedicate their life.

In organizations this works the same: in the end not only talent, but also dedication decides who makes it to the top. And don't let the word "talent" fool you here. I do not mean the talent to care for the elderly, build good software or make beautiful things. I mean the talent /to make it to the top/!

So in the end, ruthless career tigers will bubble up the hierarchy and rule the rest of us. Not because they are good care-takers, engineers or even managers, but because they are better at and more dedicated to promoting their own position. Even well-meaning managers (fortunately most of them) are no match and will be stuck in mid-level management.

This may sound cynical, and maybe it is, but I find it gives me peace. I am an engineer and like to build useful and beautiful things. That means I can't compete with people who's only objective it is to move up. So, I won't. I try to stay away from people and situations that focus to much on their own position, and build my professional life in such a way that it is as satisfying and enjoyable as possible.

* PUBLISHED 10 minute org mode 101                                      :org:
CLOSED: [2020-02-02 za 08:38]

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is a fast and effective tool to manage personal information, like notes, tasks, and references. It is also used for authoring and publishing blogs, books and academic papers. Org mode is part of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] and stores its data in plain-text files.

A versatile tool like org mode can be an intimidating beast. So, here is my org mode 101 to get you up to speed in 10 minutes flat. To make this possible, I will stick to the essential commands, and leave customization for another post.

** Editing

Org mode allows you to structure your files by using headings. Simply create a heading by beginning a line with an asterisk (\ast). Headings can be nested by adding asterisks (\ast\ast\ast for a level three heading). This way you can build an infinitely branching hierarchical tree of information. You can move headings around with =M-<arrow>= and whole subtrees with =S-M-<arrow>=.

Headings mark the beginning of a section. Within those sections can be metadata, text or further subtrees. The metadata is a whole new topic, so for now we will stick with text. The basic mark up of text looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
*Markup: *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, +strikethrough+, =verbatim=, ~code~

- list
  + nested list
    1. Numbered list
#+END_SRC

Which shows as:

Markup: *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, +strikethrough+, =verbatim=, ~code~

- list
  + other list
    1. Numbered list (cycle list types with =S-<left/right>=)

** Tasks

You can mark headers as tasks by using =S-<arrow>=. Left/right changes the todo state (shown by keywords like TODO and DONE), while up/down changes the todo priority (A for highest, C for lowest).

You can schedule a task using =C-c C-s= and set a deadline using =C-c C-d=.

** Tags

You can assign tags to headers using =C-c C-q=. A tag can be almost any text you like. I use:
- the projects the section belongs to starting with a =%= (like =%blog= and =%killer_app=),
- the person the section is relevant to starting with =@= (like =@alice= and =@bob=), or
- the context, a concept from GTD, where I can work on the task starting with =#= (like =#office= and =#home)=.
By using special markers in tags, I can more easily find the headlines I am looking for.

** Capture

Org mode comes with a ton of its own [[https://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf][key bindings]], and [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Introduction.html][advices]] to add three of your own. One of those is =C-c c= for [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Capture.html][Capturing]], which allows you to quickly jot down notes, so you can forget them, because org mode won't. All with minimal disruption of your workflow.

Once you're done entering text, you can store it in its default location using =C-c C-c= or refile and choose your own destination using =C-c C-w=.

** Agenda

After a while you will find that your tasks become unmanageable. So, one other custom binding org mode [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Introduction.html][advices]] is =C-c a= for [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html][Agenda]], which provides well-organized views of your tasks.

This is a life saver! It allows me to just dump all my tasks on one big heap and manage them through the agenda. I never bother to structure or cleanup my tasks. Searching is far more efficient than organizing [[[https://karl-voit.at/2020/01/25/avoid-complex-folder-hierarchies/][src]]]!

** Categories

Each file and each header can belong to exactly one category. You can define the category by adding =#+CATEGORY:= at the start of a file or a property drawer below a header:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Journal
:END:
#+END_SRC

Categories are an extra tool to structure your agenda views. I use these:
- Personal Knowledge Base
- Work
- Journal
- Links

As [[/2020-01-01-about%20me][indicated]] I bounce back and forth between [[https://emacs.org][Emacs]] and [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][VSCode]] for coding.

Current editors like VSCode are just more modern. Many things are so much easier. And the main selling feature of Emacs, "/the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html][extensible, customizable]] editor/", is now also available in editors [[https://www.sublimetext.com/][like]] VSCode. You have a virtually unlimited choice of plugins and can relatively easily program your own. In Javascript. And not [[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/elisp/][elisp]] (an elegant language, but just not for everyone).

The one thing that keeps driving me back to Emacs is that the key bindings are in my muscle memory. To outsiders they seem archaic and mysterious, but to me they feel comfortable and homey. When I just /think/ of opening a file, my fingers want to go =Ctrl-X Ctrl-F=. And Emacs allows me to mostly stay away from the mouse, which saves me time and context switches.

Today I read [[https://dev.to/devmount/23-lesser-known-vs-code-shortcuts-as-gif-80][this post]] and it hit me that I could try to learn shortcuts in VSCode like I did in Emacs. I am sure that many of the things I do with the keyboard in Emacs can also be done in VSCode. So, I will try to add one shortcut every day to my repertoire.

To get me going, these are some useful resources:

- =Ctrl-K Ctrl-R= in VSCode opens the keyboard reference for your platform
- =Ctrl-K Ctrl-S= in VSCode opens the [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings][keyboard shortcuts editor]] which initially shows the list of all defined key bindings
- =Ctrl-Shft-P= opens the searchable command palette, which shows keyboard shortcuts for every command
- Type =tips= in the command palette, and you get [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks][Help, Tips & Tricks]]

Keys:

| Date         | Key binding           | Effect                |
|--------------+-----------------------+-----------------------|
| <2020-01-17> | =Ctrl-Alt-Shft NumDown= | copy line to below    |
| <2020-01-20> | =Alt-Down=              | move line down        |
| <2020-01-21> | =Ctrl-R R=              | NPM rerun last script |

I am looking into a way to do ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) in Node. It seams to me that Streams are a very natural way to do this. However, Streams only seem to support simple pipelines of the form:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
    const fs = require('fs');
    const zlib = require('zlib');

    fs.createReadStream('./file.txt')                // read a file
      .pipe(zlib.createGzip())                       // zip it
      .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./file.txt.gz'));  // and write it
#+END_SRC

In a diagram this would look like:

#+CAPTION: flow diagram of a pipe
[[file:./pipe.png]]

But imagine I want to zip a file and mark it if it fails an expected checksum. In a diagram, that would look like:

#+CAPTION: flow diagram of a network
[[file:./network.png]]

In order to do that, I would need Stream operations like =split= and =join=, but these don't seem to exist.

Let's figure out how to do this!

I have been looking for a platform to blog. It should support...

- templates,
- comments,
- tags,
- archive,
- feeds (RSS or Atom) and
- search.

On the technical side, I [[/2020-01-01-about%20me/][want]] it to...

- be open source,
- allow me to edit the posts locally in any editor I please (which
  requires flat-file input),
- support Org-mode input,
- maintain version history of the content,
- deploy to Github Pages (which requires output a site without
  backend),
- be as free of tracking, ads or vendor lock-in as possible.

I have looked into e.g. [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]], [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][org-publish]], [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] and the likes, but never really liked one.

So now I have decided to see if I can start one from scratch, based on [[http://gatsbyjs.org/][Gatsby]]:

1. I started off with this [[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/][excellent tutorial]].
2. I added a [[https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages][Github pages publish workflow]] (inspired by [[https://github.com/orgapp/gatsby-starter-orga/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml][gatsby-starter-olga]]). I also needed to [[https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line][create a personal access token]] and [[https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets][store it as a secret]].
3. I added comments, using [[https://utteranc.es/][utteranc.es]] through [[https://github.com/b6pzeusbc54tvhw5jgpyw8pwz2x6gs/react-utterances][react-utterances]].
4. I added tags, archive and pinned pages myself.
5. I added RSS feeds using [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-feed/][gatsby-plugin-feed]].

Based on the Gatsby page about [[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search/][adding search]] it seems you need some backend for search. As I don't want a backend, the blog will not have a search feature for now.

[[/migrated-to-org][Update Feb 2, 2020]]: I migrated to org mode.

In /IEEE Computer magazine/ of March 1998 the original developer or Tcl/TK, John Ousterhout, [[http://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html][wrote]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Scripting languages are designed for /gluing/ applications; they use typeless approaches to achieve a higher level of programming and more rapid application development than system programming languages. Increases in computer speed and changes in the application mix are making scripting languages more and more important for applications of the future.
#+END_QUOTE

I think that more than 20 years later we can confirm that Ousterhout was right. Programming has been transformed from writing everything yourself from scratch, to finding the right components, configuring them and combining them with some code of your own. And, although strongly typed and compiled languages like Java and C# persist, scripting languages like Javascript and Python [[https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages][top]] the [[https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies][charts]].

When I learned to program (/oldtimer speaking/), there was no Internet. If I wanted to use code written by others, I bought a magazine and painstakingly copied the printed code into my trusted [[https://codeincomplete.com/posts/c64-manual-nostalgia/][C64]]. And when I say "copy", I do not mean =cp file.bas=, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program][typing]] the code one character at a time. When I was really 'lucky' I had to type long lists of meaningless numbers representing machine code. The result would be blazing fast, but hardly ever worked, because typos were almost inevitable.

To me, the biggest innovation in programming of the last decade is package managers like [[https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/][pipenv]] and [[https://yarnpkg.com/][yarn]], which make finding, installing and maintaining packages a breeze. And to top it off, documentation has improved dramatically over the last couple of years.

I mostly build full-stack websites, but also the occasional desktop application, or daemon/service.
