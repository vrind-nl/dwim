But these days you can be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-57883692\">deported</a> by democratic governments for just bragging.</p><p>You could say COVID is something to take seriously, and you would be right. You could say the Australian government acted for the Greater Good, but that is exactly what the Chinese government would have said.</p><p>It seems like science is the new religion. It used to be that disagreeing with the church could get you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair\">condemned</a>, or that cartoons of Muhammad could get you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting\">killed</a>. But these days, even the<i>carriers</i> of science criticism get accused of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57870778\">killing people</a>. Which to me seems like writing out a ticket to the state, because somebody was speeding on their highway. We are shooting the messengers.</p><p>What really worries me, is that we make tech giants responsible for the behavior of their users, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility\">with great responsibility comes great power</a> (sic). The result could be that Google <a href=\"https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9837\">controls</a> what information journalists and scholars may collect and share.</p><p>I believe that the underlying issue why disinformation is such a resilient <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-combat-fake-news-and-disinformation/\">problem</a>, and censorship is <a href=\"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.202051420\">inadequate</a> at best, is that many have lost faith in <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/science-survey-1.5291291\">science</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/05/17/public-trust-in-government-1958-2021/\">government</a>. Trust must be earned, and the very journalists and scholars we suppress are our best bet on restoring faith.</p><p>Instead of blaming big tech and forcing them to police the internet, we should let everybody do what they are meant for: companies make money, governments protect their citizens, journalists seek truth, scientists seek knowledge. What remains are the questions of ethics: what is right and what is wrong? Those we decide together, in open discussion in the media, in religions, on the street, in politics, etc., using knowledge and facts from scholars and journalists.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/censorship-worries","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bookmarks"},"metadata":{"title":"Bookmarks","date":"July 13th, 2021","tags":["emacs"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-laptop"},"metadata":{"title":"New laptop","date":"April 29th, 2022","tags":["tech"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
