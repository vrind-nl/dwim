When we combine age distribution of casualties with their life expectancy, we can calculate that we have lost a staggering 136.5 thousand life years to the virus so far (a little over 9 years per casualty).</p><p>Now the opposite side of the coin.</p><p>We have had restrictive measures for almost a year now and the effects are beginning to <a href=\"https://coronabarometer.nl/\">show</a>, including depression, obesitas and loss of fitness. A way to measure this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\">Quality-adjusted life year</a> (QALY). If we assume that the quality of life of all Dutch has been reduced by an average of <a href=\"https://www.umcg.nl/w/nieuws/mentale-gezondheid-daalt-tot-dieptepunt-sinds-begin-coronacrisisnews\">10 percent</a> we have lost almost 1.75 million QALYs this year alone. This gets worse if the quality of life deteriorates more, and this counter keeps running as long as the measures are maintained.</p><p>But even if the corona measures were lifted as of today, we would still feel their consequences. Health care to non-corona patients has been delayed or reduced, with predictable effects. We spent and lost billions during the last year, which we can no longer spend on other causes like health, education or culture. But most of all, the mental damage we have done will have long-lasting effects. Social lives have been damaged, including healthy development of young people. If we assume that it will take us 10 years to fully recover from this, we will loose a multiple of the 1.75 million QALYs before this is all over.</p><p>The losses from the virus are horrible. However, if we consider a life year and a QALY to be equal, and we accept the assumptions above, the losses of the current corona measures are over ten times worse. But they are less clearly visible: there is no funeral for a youth who lost 0.2 QALY this year. And the equality of life years and QALYs is debatable: the youth is still there, struggling through each day, but alive. I find it impossible to compare the death of one elderly (9 life years) to the loss of 0.2 QALY of 45 youths (9 QALYs in total), but I think they're both significant.</p><p>When we extrapolate the death rate to the whole Dutch <a href=\"https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/visualisaties/bevolkingsteller\">population</a> we might loose 2.4 million life years (262 thousand casualties) if we let the virus run free. This might get worse, because hospitals (and Intensive Care units in particular) will get overwhelmed. It may also be less, because the virus will probably die out before contamination of the whole population (at some point we will reach <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19\">herd immunity</a>).</p><p>I am aware that this reasoning is debatable, and the numbers are full of assumptions and estimates. But at some point the damage of the corona measures <i>will</i> overtake the loss from corona itself. Some may think we are already way past this point. Others may feel we still have a long way to go. Personally, I find it hard to pinpoint where we stand, but regardless, let's hope we soon start seeing the <a href=\"https://nos.nl/artikel/2370107-rivm-gunstig-vaccinatie-effect-zichtbaar-in-verpleeghuizen.html\">effects</a> of vaccination.</p></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[12]","metadata":{"title":"Windows on Linux","date":"2020 May 29th","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/windows-on-linux"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p>I have been running Windows and Linux side-by-side in dual-boot since forever.

The current corona measures in The Netherlands are extended for weeks and months. The policy makes perfect sense.</p><p>Except that it doesn't. To me.</p><p>To me it felt like our government is working from a different set of rules than I would. And that made me wonder what their basic principle is. The official line is the policy aims to reduce the pressure on our healthcare system, and the intensive care in particular. But I think it is this:</p><blockquote>We must prevent that people contract COVID19 at all cost and provide COVID19 patients with the absolute best medical care.</blockquote><p>Notice the \"at all cost\". We spend/loose <a href=\"https://nos.nl/artikel/2331159-grote-pensioenfondsen-diep-onder-water-77-miljard-verdampt.html\">billions</a> to save COVID19 patients. Including <a href=\"https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5092456/corona-verpleeghuizen-ouderen-besmet\">many</a> elderly in nursing homes where the average live expectancy is <a href=\"https://www.zorgvisie.nl/sterftecijfer-verpleeghuis-stijgt-met-kwart/\">less than a year</a>. Many of those are suffering from dementia, and especially for them, the lockdown is <a href=\"https://www.medischcontact.nl/opinie/lezers-schrijven/lezersverhalen/lezersverhaal/als-ook-zwaaien-niet-meer-mag.htm\">hell</a>. Wouldn't it be more humane to make their last months as pleasant as possible, instead of extending their lives with a couple of miserable, unhappy months? I am not suggesting we should scrimp on medical care, but I can't help but feel we could spend this money more wisely (e.g. on care for other patients, on education, or on saving the environment).</p><p>Notice this statement is about medical care only. Not about economy, mental health, or happiness. Yesterday our prime minister said \"National health is more important than the economy\". Who wouldn't agree? Except, we're <i>not</i> talking about national health. We are talking about personal tragedies like loosing your mother, grandfather or partner. The current number of casualties (3916) is less than 3% of the total number of 150.000 yearly deaths in the Netherlands. That would leave COVID19 on tenth place in the <a href=\"https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/ranglijst/ranglijst-doodsoorzaken-op-basis-van-sterfte\">ranking</a> of causes of death. Less than a quarter of dementia, and less than half of lung cancer, stroke and heart diseases (each). And we don't consider those \"crises\". At least, we don't lock down our whole society to fight them. We don't even ban cigarettes, soft drinks, and fast food.</p><p>Notice this is about COVID19 patients only. The care for all other patients has been reduced or even suspended. But why would their care be less important and less urgent?</p><p>Notice this is about \"absolute best\" medical care. We are told the situation on ICs is like a war zone. But when someone suggest one breathing apparatus can be used for multiple patients, this is <a href=\"https://nos.nl/artikel/2328509-twee-ic-patienten-op-een-beademingsapparaat-extreem-terughoudend-mee-zijn.html\">suboptimal</a> and only for <a href=\"https://zorgnu.avrotros.nl/nieuws/item/in-uiterst-geval-meerdere-patienten-aan-een-beademingsapparaat/\">extreme cases</a>. 600.000 face masks delivered from China were <a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/262896058/600-000-mondkapjes-uit-china-afgekeurd-door-ministerie\">rejected</a> because they did not stand up to our medical standards. So, although we are in a crisis, apparently it is not bad enough yet that we are happy with any help we can get and try to make do with what we've got.</p><p>Notice this is a doctor's objective. Which in itself is fine; it is what they are trained and paid for. But it is not about what patients want or what society wants. I feel like we need a more balanced approach.</p><p>Notice the word \"must\". To quote our prime minister yesterday: \"The freedom of one, may not harm the health of others\". I assume he meant \"freedom to go to bars/parks/churches\" and not \"civil rights\", but we have already sacrificed our freedom of movement and our privacy, so statements like this scare me. Apparently this principle is above any discussion and worth sacrificing civil rights for.</p><p>Finally, let me say this. One thing I <i>did</i> agree with in the prime minister's speech yesterday was his appreciation of the healthcare providers. We ask a lot of them in the area's that have been hit hard by the Corona virus, both in terms of workload and mental strain. But I don't <a href=\"https://www.ad.nl/home/applaus-voor-onze-helden-van-de-zorg~aeba83ee/\">applaud</a> or wave a <a href=\"https://www.persberichten.com/persbericht/97544/Vlag-voor-de-Zorg-steun-onze-zorgbranche-in-tijden-van-crisis-en-wereldwijde-coronaprojecten\">flag</a>.

But right in the middle of the Corona crisis, we are <a href=\"https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl/economie/1696986/klm-wil-2-miljard-steun-en-een-hoger-salaris-voor-de-directeur.html\">discussing</a> an <i>extra</i> bonus for the CEO of the KLM, which is also asking for state support to stay in business.

It drives children and parents insane, and keeps adults away from their jobs. And infected children almost never develop any serious symptoms, so they hardly ever sneeze, so they hardly ever contaminate others.</li><li>The pandemic seems to be highly regional (Lombardy, New York, the south of The Netherlands).</li><li>I am <a href=\"covid-19\">still</a> not convinced that COVID-19 is significantly worse than the common flu. What I think we <i>can</i> all agree on, is that COVID-19 is <i>new</i>, which means nobody had any immunity against it. I can't help but wonder if that is sufficient to explain the current pandemic.</li></ul></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>What I think we should do</h1><p>This is going to take longer than anyone of us will be comfortable with. The IC personel can't keep this up for more than a couple of months, locked-up people go mad, and we need to have a healthy economy to pay for all this. I fear that in a couple of weeks the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLu07aXTEKY\">holier than thou</a> types and the <i>this doesn't concern me</i> types will have grown so far apart, that conflicts become inevitable. So, our society needs to get back to normal soon, and we need to find other ways than a lock-down to deal with this pandemic:</p><ul><li>We should <i>not</i> sacrifice our civil rights. They are more important than the stress on ICs, the economy, or anyone we are trying to save from COVID-19.</li><li>We should relax a bit about the 1.5m rule. We should avoid situations where we are packed together over longer periods of time (like in movie theaters), where we sing and shout (like churches and bars), and/or with bad ventilation (like saunas and festival tents). So, we <i>should</i> keep the ban on gatherings, but we shouldn't worry too much if we pass each other in parks or super market aisles.</li><li>We should stay at home if we have any symptoms or suspicions (like contact with someone with symptoms), but we should get back to work otherwise. Be smart about it: work from home if you can, not too many people in one room (use video-conferencing), avoid physical contact.</li><li>We should keep quarantining known and suspected cases.</li><li>We should customize our approach per region. I live in the <a href=\"https://www.dvhn.nl/groningen/Experts-Misschien-kan-het-Noorden-wel-eerder-uit-de-lockdown-dan-de-rest-van-Nederland-25564568.html\">north</a> of The Netherlands, where we have only a few casualties, while in the south it runs in the thousands. Solidarity is important, but nobody gains from killing the economy here, to solve a problem elsewhere.</li><li>We should enable and support elderly (and other vulnerable population groups) if they want to self-isolate. But if they don't, we should also allow contact with their loved ones. I suspect this is hard to execute (what with dementia, what with conflicting wishes in nursing homes, etc.), but we should at least <i>try</i> to give them control over their own lives.</li><li>We should open schools again, except perhaps in highly contaminated regions.</li><li>We should stop obsessing about daily numbers. They are meaningless. And although statistics (not the same as daily body counts in bold headlines) are a powerful tool, if I have learned anything from my college classes, it is that <i>statistics are tricky</i>. So, remember: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics\">lies, damn lies, and statistics</a>.</li></ul><p>And remember the disclaimer above.</p></div></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[16]","metadata":{"title":"COVID-19 vs Y2K","date":"2020 April 8th","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/covid-19-vs-y2k"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p>In some ways the COVID-19 pandemic reminds me of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem\">Y2K bug</a>.

Also, in Belgium <a href=\"https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-rivm-115-nieuwe-sterfgevallen-drukte-in-natuur-lijkt-opnieuw-mee-te-vallen#UPDATE-container-44494253\">today</a> more corona-patients left the hospital than entered (granted, Belgium is not Holland, but still). <a href=\"https://nos.nl/artikel/2329389-de-coronacijfers-van-4-april-minder-nieuwe-ziekenhuis-en-ic-opnames.html\">Yesterday's</a> statistics already show the growth of IC admissions slowing down. With this trend it would seem that the current capacity of 1900 will be more than sufficient, and the feared 2500 seem unlikely. The latest <a href=\"https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-instroom-op-intensive-care-vlakt-af-doelstelling-ic-bedden-gehaald\">news</a> from the national coordination centre seems to confirm this.</p><p>So, the question is when and how will we turn from <a href=\"https://www.nd.nl/nieuws/varia/961390/rutte-grootste-crisis-in-vredestijd-sinds-woii\">this is the biggest disaster since WWII</a> to \"let's be reasonable about this\". Politicians and policy makers cannot change their minds, without serious repercussions for their credibility and careers. Also, sudden changes in policy may lead to social unrest. So, this needs to be spinned carefully.</p><p>I think the <i>when</i> cannot be far away, because the <a href=\" https://www.lastampa.it/cronaca/2020/04/03/news/esce-il-sole-strade-e-piazze-affollate-con-la-scusa-della-spesa-1.38674825\">situation</a> in Italy shows there's an end to how long people will endure a lock-down. So I expect the coming two weeks the pressure will rise. For example, when it becomes clear that hundreds of IC-beds are remaining empty. Gradually, more <a href=\"https://nos.nl/nieuwsuur/artikel/2329144-sterftecijfers-moeten-die-elke-dag-zo-expliciet-in-het-nieuws.html\">critical</a> messages will become more acceptable and more main stream. The media will more and more start to question the wisdom of the current lock-down. But it is not politically viable to change tack before the end of the current measures on April 28.</p><p>The <i>how</i> is trickier, but I expect the tone will be \"now we've brought COVID-19 successfully under control, we need to turn our attention to the economy\". Look at <a href=\"https://nos.nl/liveblog/2329431-instroom-op-intensive-care-vlakt-af-doelstelling-ic-bedden-gehaald\">how</a> the possible over-capacity of IC beds is presented: \"target achieved\". I expect the common sense measures (wash you hands, reduce social contacts) will remain in place for some time, but the economy-killing measures like closing schools and the catering and entertainment industries will be reduced gradually by the end of the month.

Not by choice, but by necessity. For many of us, this is new territory, for some of us it isn't.</p><p>I have been working from home for 15+ years. In this post I share how I make that work.</p><div class=\"section\"><h1>My typical work day</h1><p>The rest of this post I will try to keep as general as possible, but the tips below are inspired by my personal situation. So, it helps if you know what that situation is like:</p><ul><li>I am a software engineer. Working for me means responding to email and phone calls, writing documents, and coding. That means the most specific tools I need are a desk and a more than decent computer.</li><li>We have kids at home between the ages of 14 and 20.</li><li>A couple of times a week I have meetings with customers. Usually at their premises.</li></ul></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Demand your own space</h1><p>Nothing kills my productivity like regular interrupts from other members of our household. My daughter comes for a hug, my spouse comes to discuss diner plans, other kids come to share the latest news, and on, and on, and on. All of them valid reasons to ask my attention, but it requires me to switch context a couple of times an hour if I let it go.</p><p>So, I taught my kids that even though I am at home, I really am at work. Just like other parents cannot be disturbed at their office, I cannot be disturbed at mine.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't work. They can see me sitting there, so I <i>must</i> be available. So, I get grumpy and tell them \"if it doesn't bleed, I don't need to know\". This may sound harsh, but for me it's the only way to get work done.</p><p>This is getting easier now the kids are getting older. They better understand the concepts of focus and distraction. They better understand that my work pays their bills. With younger kids this is harder, especially in these strange and disturbing times. They need and deserve more attention from their parents than usual. But if you want to get work done, demand to be left alone at least some of the time.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Take a break</h1><p>I learned the hard way that working without regular breaks is bad for me. RSI in my neck and shoulder have hampered my productivity for years. So these days I work in 45 minutes intervals. At first I needed a timer (I used <a href=\"http://www.workrave.org/\">Workrave</a>) but by now my internal clock reminds me to take a break. And if I ignore that, my neck and shoulder will remind me.</p><p>During those breaks, I eat a snack, walk the dog, clean the kitchen counter top, go for a jog, put the laundry in the dryer, buy groceries, or just watch TV. You would think these breaks would be a good time to talk with the kids (they certainly think so), but to me that is <i>not</i> time off. It doesn't let me relax.</p><p>In my case, a <i>break</i> is meant to turn off my brain for a moment. So, exercise is great, and simple chores and mindless entertainment also work. But when your work is more physical in nature, this may be just the other way around. Find out what works for you, but relax at regular intervals.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Reduce distractions</h1><p>Apart from distraction by members of our household, there are many other distractions. As my work is digital by nature, I am online all the time. And, as you know (because you are reading this), the web is a quagmire of distractions, with websites specifically designed to lure you in.</p><p>So, I use separate browser windows: one for private email, one for business email, and one for actual work. The first two are minimized most of the time (actually, they are in a separate <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/shell-workspaces.html.en\">workspace</a>), and I have developed the habit to keep them that way. I only check my email two or three times a day and use the <a href=\"https://www.process.st/inbox-zero/\">Inbox Zero</a> approach. This means I handle each incoming email as follows:</p><ol><li>Delete if not relevant</li><li>Do now if it is done within two minutes</li><li>Defer by putting it in your <a href=\"/what-is-org-mode\">task management</a> if it needs more time</li><li>Delegate if somebody else can do it better</li><li>Respond (this I always do when appropriate, if only to let them know their message was received)</li></ol><p>After steps 2 though 5 I archive the email, so my inbox is almost always mostly empty.</p><p>Finally, I have adopted the habit to only read social media and news feeds on my tablet. That tablet is in our living room, so social media and news feeds do not distract me when I am working at my desk. I read those during my breaks, but mostly during the evening.</p><p>I am aware that most of these strategies depend on self-discipline and developing habits, but I am afraid that's a fact of life when your working at home.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Keep a regular schedule</h1><p>Every morning I get up with my spouse. When she leaves for the office, I start work too (and save 40 minutes commute time twice a day). Around noon I have my lunch break. And I start cooking diner around 5 p.m. This regular schedule helps me to get in the 'work mood' and to switch it off again at the end of the day.</p><p>And don't underestimate the importance of the latter. You may tempted to think that all that time you spent during the day on chores, breaks, your kids and online news must be compensated in the evening, but that is not true. I find I am way more productive at home than I ever was in the office, with distracting managers, meaningless meetings that drag on forever, small-talk at the coffee machine, and so on. Don't get me wrong, just like the distractions at home, these are important elements of the social fabric that build communities, but they <i>do</i> keep you from being productive <i>now</i>.</p><p>Just as office workers you should adopt the OA5 strategy (<i>Out at 5</i> from chapter 26 of <a href=\"https://thegistyoumissed.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/the-dilbert-principle-by-scott-adams/\">The Dilbert Principle</a>).</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Use available tools</h1><p>I use the following tools (usually on <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a>) for remote cooperation, in order of frequency:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/what-is-org-mode\">Org mode</a> for task management</li><li>email (GMail in my case) for communication with customers</li><li>Whatsapp for private communication (I try to keep business communication away from Whatsapp, but that doesn't always work)</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/otech-nl\">Github</a> for version management, issue management, and code sharing</li><li>my <a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-moto-x4-android-one/p\">phone</a></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/\">Google docs</a> for documents</li><li><a href=\"https://www.skype.com/\">Skype</a> for conference calls, mainly because of its feature that let's you share you desktop with others</li><li><a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> for groups</li><li><a href=\"https://www.teamviewer.com/\">TeamViewer</a> and <a href=\"https://remmina.org/\">Remmina</a> for remote access (only occasionally)</li></ul></div></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[19]","metadata":{"title":"COVID-19","date":"2020 March 23rd","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/covid-19"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p>Just like everybody else COVID-19 is on my mind constantly these days.

Ioannidis of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (<a href=\"https://metrics.stanford.edu/\">METRICS</a>), comes with some provoking statements:</p><ul><li>The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable.</li><li>Reported case fatality rates, like the official 3.4% rate from the World Health Organization, cause horror — and are meaningless.</li><li>If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\">PCR tests</a>, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year.</li><li>Draconian countermeasures have been adopted in many countries.

But newer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html\">reports</a> [March 20] suggest the number was much lower there, more like 1.4%.</p><p>The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM) of the University of Oxford <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">explains</a> that the <i>Infection Rate Fatality</i> (IFR) differs from the <i>Case Fatality  Rate</i> (CFR) in that it aims to estimate the fatality rate in <i>all</i> those with infection: the patients who have been tested positive (cases) and those with an undetected disease (asymptomatic and not tested group). \"Our current best assumption, as of the 22nd March, is the IFR  is approximate 0.19%.\" What this means is clearly visible in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0755b30-69bb-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">Germany</a> where 24,873 people have been tested positive and 94 have died (0.4%): the point here is that Germany performs 160,000 COVID-19 tests every week which means they find far more infections than any other country, but their fatality rate is much lower.</p><p>Ioannidis refers to the <a href=\"https://www.princess.com/news/notices_and_advisories/notices/diamond-princess-update.html\">Diamond Princess Cruise Ship</a> as one situation where an entire, closed population was tested (six deaths occurred out of 705 who tested positive constituting a CFR of 0.85%. All six deaths six occurred in patients > 70. No one under 70 died): \"Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%.\" (the article continues with further nuances). This is confirmed by this <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031773v2\">study</a>: comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, they estimated CFR 1.1% and IFR 0.5%.</p><p>To put things in perspective, the seasonal flu in the Netherlands (17 million people) cost 9,500 deaths in <a href=\"https://www.snpg.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/infographic-RIVM-Griep-in-beeld-winter-2017-18.pdf\">season 2017/2018</a> [Dutch] and hardly anybody noticed. Compare this to the 179 deaths from COVID-19 in The Netherlands now (March 22), or the 5476 deaths in Italy (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy\">Lombardy</a> has 10 million inhabitants) and the 3275 deaths in China (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan\">Wuhan</a> has 11 million). The season 2017/2018 was a severe flu season in The Netherlands but <a href=\"https://www.volksgezondheidenzorg.info/onderwerp/influenza/cijfers-context/sterfte\">other seasons</a> [Dutch] still show significant numbers.</p><p>We have had similar outbreaks of viruses in the past, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic\">2009/2010 swine or Mexican flu pandamic</a> with estimates of 700 million-1.4 billion confirmed cases and 151,700-575,400 deaths. These are staggering numbers, but in The Journal of the American Medical Association as early as Sept 8 2010 Edward A. Belongia and colleagues <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/186549\">report</a> numbers that suggest that the swine flu were no worse than the seasonal flu. The WHO <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-flu-who/world-must-prepare-for-inevitable-next-flu-pandemic-who-says-idUSKBN1QS1EP\">confirmed</a> in 2019 that swine flu ended up with a fatality rate of 0.02%. And this pandemic also saw the Mexican government closing most of Mexico city and clinics in some areas being overwhelmed by infected people.</p><p>CEBM conclude that evaluating CFR during a pandemic is a hazardous exercise, and high-end estimates must be treated with caution as the H1N1 pandemic highlights that original estimates were off by a factor greater than 10.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h2>How effective is the current strategy?</h2><p><i>Flatten the curve</i> and <i>Social Distancing</i> are the current strategies of choice. CEBM <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/what-is-the-evidence-for-social-distancing-during-global-pandemics-a-rapid-summary-of-current-knowledge/\">states</a>: \"Although limited, the best available evidence appears to support social distancing measures as a means of reducing transmission and delaying spread. Staggered and cumulative implementation of these interventions may prove most effective. The timing and duration of such measures is critical.\" but <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/what-is-the-evidence-for-mass-gatherings-during-global-pandemics/\">also</a>: \"The effect of restricting and cancelling mass gatherings and sporting events on infectious diseases is poorly established and requires further assessment. The best-available evidence suggests multiple-day events with crowded communal accommodations are most associated with increased risk. Mass gatherings are not homogenous and risk should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\"</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h2>Where is this going?</h2><p>Michael Levitt, an American-British-Israeli biophysicist who won the 2013 Nobel prize for chemistry has <a href=\"https://m.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Israeli-nobel-laureate-Coronavirus-spread-is-slowing-621145\">monitored</a> [March 20] the virus in China since the early days. He predicted the current decline in number of infections two weeks before it happened and now predicts the virus will disappear from China by the end of March. This <a href=\"http://www.casperalbers.nl/nl/post/2020-03-11-coronagrafieken/\">explanation</a> [March 11, Dutch] by Applied Statistics professor Casper Albers shows why the exponential model to predict new cases doesn't fit the data, but that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression\">logistic regression</a> does and probably provides a better model.</p><p>Notice the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number\">definition</a> of the infection rate <i>R0</i>:</p><blockquote>the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.</blockquote><p>The key words here are \"susceptible to infection\". Of course, in time not all individuals will be susceptible to infection anymore and the virus will die out. And the more contagious a virus is, the sooner this will happen.</p><p>The social media bombard us with cries of panic and pleas for help from doctors and nurses from Italy, but we also get <a href=\"https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/02/26/news/coronavirus_la_virologa_gismondo_e_le_notti_in_laboratorio_contro_la_psicosi_basta_la_verita_ora_tanti_mi_stanno_dando_ra-249593378/?refresh_ce\">this interview</a> [Feb 26, Italian] with Maria Rita Gismondo, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.asst-fbf-sacco.it/reparti-e-servizi/info/microbiologia-clinica-virologia-e-diagnostica-bioemergenze\">Laboratory</a> of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and bio-emergencies in Milan, who states \"There is a bombardment of news that foment fear, there has been a collective brainwashing\", but COVID-19 \"is little more than a normal flu\", and \"we are <i>not</i> at war\".

It may be bad, but it may also be comparable to the common flu. We just don't know yet.</p><p>That makes we wonder why the response is so strong and why COVID-19 has lead to draconian measures like totally locking down entire countries. I can come up with a number of possible explanations:</p><div class=\"section\"><h2>COVID-19 may actually be worse</h2><p>From the looks of it, I get the impression that COVID-19 is <i>fast</i>. The numbers may be similar to those of the common flu, but they are achieved in weeks instead of months. That pushes us to also <i>respond</i> fast. Don't think, act!</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h2>FUD</h2><p>In marketing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt\">FUD</a>, for <i>Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt</i>, is a well-known strategy. It pushes people towards the perceived safer option.</p><p>These days we are used to big data giving immediate answers. We are used to be in control: when you're sick, go to the doctor. The doctor knows best.</p><p>So, when we see experts without answers and doctors panicking, we start to panic too, and flock to anyone who pretends to have a solution.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h2>Social media</h2><p>Even during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, social media were not as ubiquitous as they are today. Back then we got updates a couple of times a day, mostly text, sometimes with a photo. These days we get updates almost live and with video. That has a significantly different impact by instilling a constant sense of urgency.</p><p>If we got similarly frequent updates about the common flu during flu season, we might respond as we do now. In fact, <a href=\"http://flunewseurope.org/\">similar maps</a> exist, but probably don't get the same amount of traffic as those for COVID-19 (<a href=\"https://localfocus2.appspot.com/5e6f877460e13\">this map</a> shows the global numbers and <a href=\"https://localfocus2.appspot.com/5e68e7405456b\">this map</a> shows the Dutch situation).</p><p>Moreover, even more than in tradition news sources, on social media panic mongers get the same amount of screen time as experts, if not more. Experts are difficult, while demagogues provide snappy sound bites. We bother less and less with the longer, more complicated, but also more nuanced articles.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h2>Sign of the times</h2><p>I feel like we live in times where small vocal groups have a strong grip on the media and politicians.</p><p>In The Netherlands the official guide lines are:</p><ul><li>wash you hands and sneeze in the inside of your elbow</li><li>keep 1.5 meters distance (so, don't shake hands)</li><li>work at home if possible</li><li>stay at home if you don't feel well (sneezing, coughing, fever)</li><li>events with more than 100 attendees have been cancelled</li></ul><p>Schools have been closed since March 16. Not because experts thought it necessary, but <a href=\"https://www.parool.nl/nederland/coronavirus-is-nachtmerrie-voor-kabinet-niemand-wil-een-lockdown~b2315da1/\">because</a> [Dutch] \"society voted with their feet\". In other words: the government had no other choice, because school leaders wanted to close and parents kept their kids at home.</p><p>Also, on social media people are shamed for visiting parks, letting their children play outside, and generally being social. Usually by <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/karen\">Karens</a> on Twitter, celebrities in talk shows or other non-experts. They seem to feel the need to 'educate' their fellow citizens and demonstrate their superior correctness.</p><p>But also local mayors and individual medical professionals feel the need to be stricter that the official guide-lines. They seem to think they know better than multi-disciplinary teams of experts that weighed the pros and cons of all options. As a software developer, I know that local optimization may have disastrous global side-effects.</p></div></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>We just don't know yet, and anybody who suggest they do are lying.</p><p>My two cents, and remember I am no expert, so this is not much more than divination and is intended primarily for myself to look back and see where I was most wrong:</p><ul><li>I support the moderate approach chosen by the Dutch government (mind your hygiene and reduce your number of social contacts). It makes sense and won't hurt. But more draconian measures like total lock-downs may be less effective and more harmful than we think. Especially long-term.</li><li>COVID-19 is a nasty, aggressive bug and I fear we're up for a couple of rough weeks. I hope that in The Netherlands by mid April the worst will be over and around May we will pretty much be back to normal. But I am known to be an optimist.

As I come from the traditional world of RDBMSs, this does not come naturally to me. But the more I work with Javascript, the more natural the step to Mongo becomes.</p><p>So far, my attempts to use Mongo failed, due to my inability to overcome the learning curve. In this post I will discuss one of my the biggest hurdles: embedded documents and many-to-many-relationships.</p><p>In the relational world I hardly ever work in the database directly. I almost always use an ORM like <a href=\"https://www.sqlalchemy.org/\">SQLAlchemy</a>, <a href=\"https://sequelize.org/\">Sequelize</a>, or <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent\">Eloquent</a>. In the past I worked on projects with <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor</a> which uses Mongo as a backend and uses <a href=\"https://guide.meteor.com/collections.html#schemas\">schemas</a> to help manage your data. <a href=\"https://mongoosejs.com/\">Mongoose</a> provides similar functionality, which I like.</p><p>Documents in MongoDB are hierarchical by nature. They easily map to JSON and Javascript objects, which makes the match with Javascript so elegant. This means that 1:n relations are modeled by having nested documents.</p><p>For example, in my current project organisations have teams, which in turn have members. The organisations data would look like:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Universal Exports\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      teams<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"development\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          members<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"marketing\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          members<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"ACME\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      teams<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"design\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          members<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"production\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n          members<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code></pre><p>Team members are the system's users. Each team has multiple members and every user can be member of multiple teams. This results in a many-to-many-relationship, which can no longer be modeled hierarchically. Instead of containing the user data itself, the members refer to the ids of the users and the users are in their own collection.</p><p>Similarly, I could have chosen to make teams a separate collection and have the <code>teams</code> field of the organisation refer to the team ids. But in that case, a embedded document is more natural as each team belongs to exactly one organisation. Making organisations and teams separate collections would have been the relational way, and then I should have stayed with Sequelize and Postgres.</p><p>I run into the limitations of my Mongo knowledge as I attempt to find the teams a user belongs to. I tried some queries in the Mongo client:</p><pre><code class=\"language-js\">db<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>organisations<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">find</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>teams<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>members<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">ObjectId</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"5e5146d2b941b21ccea02c48\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// no response</span>\n\ndb<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>organisations<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">find</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token string\">\"teams.members\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">ObjectId</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">\"5e5146d2b941b21ccea02c48\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// gives the correct organisation, but includes all teams</span></code></pre><p>So far, I haven't been able to figure out how to get the relavant teams only. So, I end up writing Javascript code instead of Mongo queries.

But actually, Emacs is very beginner-friendly, because it comes standard with a plethora of help features. In this post, I'll give some starting points, and show what help functions I use the most.</p><p>First, just start up a vanilla Emacs (use <code>emacs -q</code> to bypass any user configuration files, if necessary) and the startup screen provides you with some helpful entry points, like the Emacs manual and <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/\">guided tour</a>. Of course, you can find the same information, and much more, under the <i>Help</i> menu item.</p><p>The manual that you can open from the startup screen teaches you some Emacs jargon, like how key bindings are defined. It provides an interactive introduction with exercises you can perform in the same buffer. It teaches you the Emacs-way to do things like navigate a document. To my taste its a bit dogmatic about that: I prefer arrow keys and PgUp/Dn to navigate, but the tutorial sticks to <code>C-v/M-v</code> and the likes.</p><p>The startup screen also contains a link to the Emacs manual, which introduces us to the wonderful world of <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/info-stnd/html_node/index.html\">Info</a>. We'll come back to that later, when we discuss the <code>C-h</code> key. For now, let's assume that Info is like the web: hypertext with links. So, open the manual and have a look around. What I like to do every now and then, is page though the documents by just pressing the space bar repeatedly. This is like leafing through a book and never fails to uncover gems I didn't know yet.</p><p>Section 1 \"The Organization of the Screen\" introduces much Emacs jargon that may put off beginners. This section explains words like <i>frame</i>, <i>window</i>, <i>buffer</i>, <i>point</i>, <i>mode line</i> and <i>mini buffer</i>, all essential to be able to use all other information that is available to us.</p><p>Then, when you actually start to use Emacs, the menu bar provides access to most common commands, including the key bindings that go with them for commands you find you need most often. <i>Please</i> resist the urge to install all those shiny third-party packages for now, and first dig through all the features that Emacs ships with out of the box, like searching, bookmarks, email and version control. Also have a look at all you can customize through the <i>Options</i> menu. But again, <i>please</i> stick with the defaults at first. They have been selected based on years of experience, and more often than not make more sense that you might think at first (promise!).</p><p>Finally, I you ever wonder <i>How do I do X?</i> <code>C-h</code> is your friend:</p><ul><li><code>C-h ?</code> shows all help command, including the ones I use most:</li><li><code>C-h a</code> (apropos) show commands matching a pattern</li><li><code>C-h k</code> describes a key</li><li><code>C-h f</code> describes a function (by default the function under point) and the keys associated with it</li><li><code>C-h v</code> describes a variable, its current value, its original value, and its possible values</li><li><code>C-h m</code> describes all currently active modes</li><li><code>C-h i</code> starts Info, which opens a whole library full of manuals, I don't believe you I will ever finish in this lifetime</li></ul><p>Have fun exploring Emacs!</p></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[27]","metadata":{"title":"Work vs problems","date":"2020 February 11th","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/work-vs-problems"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p>I distinguish between work and problems.</p><p>Work can be done by following well-known, accepted rules.

It's not even clear how to know which solution is best, because problems usually have multiple perspectives with (possibly conflicting) interests. Problems may even have multiple stakeholders.

I was listening to <a href=\"https://emacscast.org/episode_3/\">Emacscast</a> today, and the explanation by host Rakhim inspired this post.</p><p>Basically, I see Org mode as three parts:</p><dl><dt>a markup language</dt><dd>The markup language supports structuring with nested sections and formatting like for example Markdown. Unlike Markdown, and more like XML, org mode also supports meta data, like categories, tags, and properties</dd><dt>an editor</dt><dd>Org mode is part of Emacs, so when editing org mode, you can use all functions that Emacs provides.

This ensures you never loose access to your data. The editor is where org mode begins to distinguish itself: editors like <a href=\"https://github.com/vscode-org-mode/vscode-org-mode\">VSCode</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode\">Vim</a> and <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/orgmode\">Sublime</a> support only a small subset of the features you get when editing org mode in Emacs. But the modules are where org mode really starts to shine. They add such amazingly powerful features that they make org mode unlike any other tool I know.</p><p>The strength of these modules is that they are <del>integrated</del> loosely coupled. By that I mean they have maximum cohesion and minimum dependency. And by that I mean that the modules form a suite where every tool works together with the others, but the do not <i>need</i> each other.

In <a href=\"http://www.dilbert.com/\">The Dilbert Principle</a> Scott Adams suggests that the main task of management is to \"Eliminate the Assholes\". However, my view is that management <i>are</i> the assholes. Nothing personal, so let me explain.</p><p>We are all constantly working for (1) our own position and (2) the higher good. Working for our own position may mean making our work as enjoyable as possible, maximizing status/income/power, or anything that you want to achieve for yourself. The higher good is the reason your job exists in the first place: the business of your customers, some political ideal, or a charity.</p><p>Most people most of the time look for a middle ground between their own position and the higher good. They try to strike a balance where the one not does not harm the other. But sometimes this doesn't work and you have to make a choice. For example, if you stand up for an important but unpopular policy, it may help the higher good, but it may harm your position.</p><p>This also works in unexpected ways. For example, if you work late to provide a critical feature for your client before its deadline, you would think this would help both the higher good and your position. But the latter is rarely the case. We are often not rewarded for extra effort we put in. Why is this?</p><p>I think this is because some people do <i>not</i> balance their own position and the higher good, but instead choose just one of these. In particular, some people focus exclusively on their own position, and work for their own promotion only. So in the contest for income, status or power, these people win from anyone who divide their focus between their position and the higher good.</p><p>It is just as in sports: to really make it to the top, you have to sacrifice everything and everyone and put all your effort into becoming the best you can be at your chosen sport. This doesn't mean success is guaranteed if you do that (in fact, chances are remote), because others who do the same may have more talent. But it <i>does</i> mean you will be more successful than people with similar talent who do not dedicate their life.</p><p>In organizations this works the same: in the end not only talent, but also dedication decides who makes it to the top. And don't let the word \"talent\" fool you here. I do not mean the talent to care for the elderly, build good software or make beautiful things. I mean the talent <i>to make it to the top</i>!</p><p>So in the end, ruthless career tigers will bubble up the hierarchy and rule the rest of us. Not because they are good care-takers, engineers or even managers, but because they are better at and more dedicated to promoting their own position. Even well-meaning managers (fortunately most of them) are no match and will be stuck in mid-level management.</p><p>This may sound cynical, and maybe it is, but I find it gives me peace. I am an engineer and like to build useful and beautiful things. That means I can't compete with people who's only objective it is to move up. So, I won't. I try to stay away from people and situations that focus to much on their own position, and build my professional life in such a way that it is as satisfying and enjoyable as possible.</p></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[31]","metadata":{"title":"10 minute org mode 101","date":"2020 February 2nd","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/10-minute-org-mode-101"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/\">Org mode</a> is a fast and effective tool to manage personal information, like notes, tasks, and references. It is also used for authoring and publishing blogs, books and academic papers. Org mode is part of <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs\">Emacs</a> and stores its data in plain-text files.</p><p>A versatile tool like org mode can be an intimidating beast. So, here is my org mode 101 to get you up to speed in 10 minutes flat. To make this possible, I will stick to the essential commands, and leave customization for another post.</p><div class=\"section\"><h1>Editing</h1><p>Org mode allows you to structure your files by using headings. Simply create a heading by beginning a line with an asterisk (\\ast). Headings can be nested by adding asterisks (\\ast\\ast\\ast for a level three heading). This way you can build an infinitely branching hierarchical tree of information. You can move headings around with <code>M-&#x3C;arrow></code> and whole subtrees with <code>S-M-&#x3C;arrow></code>.</p><p>Headings mark the beginning of a section. Within those sections can be metadata, text or further subtrees. The metadata is a whole new topic, so for now we will stick with text. The basic mark up of text looks like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-org\">*Markup: *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, +strikethrough+, =verbatim=, ~code~\n\n- list\n  + nested list\n    1. Numbered list</code></pre><p>Which shows as:</p><p>Markup: <strong>bold</strong>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underlined</u>, <del>strikethrough</del>, <code>verbatim</code>, <code>code</code></p><ul><li>list<ul><li>other list<ol><li>Numbered list (cycle list types with <code>S-&#x3C;left/right></code>)</li></ol></li></ul></li></ul></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Tasks</h1><p>You can mark headers as tasks by using <code>S-&#x3C;arrow></code>. Left/right changes the todo state (shown by keywords like TODO and DONE), while up/down changes the todo priority (A for highest, C for lowest).</p><p>You can schedule a task using <code>C-c C-s</code> and set a deadline using <code>C-c C-d</code>.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Tags</h1><p>You can assign tags to headers using <code>C-c C-q</code>. A tag can be almost any text you like. I use:</p><ul><li>the projects the section belongs to starting with a <code>%</code> (like <code>%blog</code> and <code>%killer_app</code>),</li><li>the person the section is relevant to starting with <code>@</code> (like <code>@alice</code> and <code>@bob</code>), or</li><li>the context, a concept from GTD, where I can work on the task starting with <code>#</code> (like <code>#office</code> and <code>#home)</code>.</li></ul><p>By using special markers in tags, I can more easily find the headlines I am looking for.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Capture</h1><p>Org mode comes with a ton of its own <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf\">key bindings</a>, and <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/guide/Introduction.html\">advices</a> to add three of your own. One of those is <code>C-c c</code> for <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/guide/Capture.html\">Capturing</a>, which allows you to quickly jot down notes, so you can forget them, because org mode won't. All with minimal disruption of your workflow.</p><p>Once you're done entering text, you can store it in its default location using <code>C-c C-c</code> or refile and choose your own destination using <code>C-c C-w</code>.</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Agenda</h1><p>After a while you will find that your tasks become unmanageable. So, one other custom binding org mode <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/guide/Introduction.html\">advices</a> is <code>C-c a</code> for <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/advanced-searching.html\">Agenda</a>, which provides well-organized views of your tasks.</p><p>This is a life saver! It allows me to just dump all my tasks on one big heap and manage them through the agenda. I never bother to structure or cleanup my tasks. Searching is far more efficient than organizing <a href=\"[https://karl-voit.at/2020/01/25/avoid-complex-folder-hierarchies/\">src</a>]!</p></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Categories</h1><p>Each file and each header can belong to exactly one category. You can define the category by adding <code>#+CATEGORY:</code> at the start of a file or a property drawer below a header:</p><pre><code class=\"language-org\">:PROPERTIES:\n:CATEGORY: Journal\n:END:</code></pre><p>Categories are an extra tool to structure your agenda views. I use these:</p><ul><li>Personal Knowledge Base</li><li>Work</li><li>Journal</li><li>Links</li></ul></div><div class=\"section\"><h1>Further reading</h1><p>Here are some references from beginner to advanced:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html\">Org4Beginners</a> to get a quick overview of what org mode can do: editing, navigating</li><li><a href=\"http://thagomizer.com/blog/2017/03/16/five-useful-org-mode-features.html\">5 useful features</a> with info about tables, tags, embedded code</li><li><a href=\"http://emacslife.com/blog-posts/2014-01-13-tips-learning-org-mode-emacs.html\">Emacs Life</a> tips for learning org mode</li><li><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/orgcard.pdf\">RefCard</a> a 2-page PDF with a load of key bindings (<a href=\"https://orgmode.org/orgcard.txt\">text version</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/guide/\">Guide</a> a compact version of the manual with all the essentials</li><li><a href=\"https://karl-voit.at/2019/09/25/using-orgmode/\">UOMF</a> Using Org Mode Features</li><li><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/worg/\">Community</a> documentation at Worg</li><li><a href=\"https://orgmode.org/manual/\">Manual</a> everything you could ever want to know about org mode</li><li><a href=\"http://ehneilsen.net/notebook/orgExamples/org-examples.html\">Cookbook</a> examples of advanced topics like diagrams and spreadsheets</li></ol></div></div>"},{"id":"fda0bb5e-5d35-5401-9fb5-994f9bcecd3c >>> OrgFile >>> OrgContent[32]","metadata":{"title":"Migrated to org","date":"2020 February 2nd","keyword":"PUBLISHED","pinned":null},"fields":{"slug":"/migrated-to-org"},"html":"<div class=\"section\"><p>I migrated <a href=\"/setting-up-this-blog\">my setup</a> of this blog to <a href=\"https://orgmode.org/\">org mode</a>, using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-orga/\">gatsby-transformer-orga</a>.

Increases in computer speed and changes in the application mix are making scripting languages more and more important for applications of the future.</blockquote><p>I think that more than 20 years later we can confirm that Ousterhout was right. Programming has been transformed from writing everything yourself from scratch, to finding the right components, configuring them and combining them with some code of your own.
