But then it occured to me that org files can easily be encrypted, so now I use that instead.</p><p>Just add the extension <code>.gpg</code> to your file (so <code>vault.org</code> becomes <code>vault.org.gpg</code>) and you're good to go. The double extension lets Emacs know its both encrypted and an org file.</p><p>If you want to hide that the file is an org file, you can even rename your file to just e.g. <code>vault.gpg</code> and start your file with:</p><pre><code class=\"language-org\"># -*- coding: utf-8; mode: org -*-</code></pre><p>I love how org mode turns out to be the perfect PIM with every new step. And I was glad to find that EasyPG worked out of the box even on Windows.</p><p>The only downside was that you need to enter your password in a popup window, instead of in the minibuffer. This is easily remedied by customizing <code>(epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback)</code>.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/emacs--gpg--easypg","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/website-monitoring"},"metadata":{"title":"Website monitoring","date":"June 5th, 2022","tags":["dev"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-laptop-arrived"},"metadata":{"title":"New laptop arrived","date":"June 8th, 2022","tags":["tech","windows"]}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
