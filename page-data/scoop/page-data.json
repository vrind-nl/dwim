Winget is a big stap up from manually downloading and installing applications, but in the end it is mainly just a wrapper around the application installer. You still get installer popups, which started to get under my skin.</p><p>So far, scoop works great:</p><ul><li>I have reinstalled all applications (except those from Microsoft, just to stay in touch with the Microsoft way of installing).</li><li>installation is much faster</li><li>you get parallel downloads with <a href=\"http://aria2.github.io/\">aria2</a> and administrator access with sudo</li><li>no more setup dialogues</li></ul><p>The main downside is that spplication icons seem to get lost, somehow. They are visible in <code>~/scoop/apps</code>, but not in <code>~/scoop/shims</code>. Also, some apps (like NotePad++) open a terminal when they start from a file association in file explorer.</p><p>I also kept Docker under winget, because I couldn't get <code>dockerd</code> working properly. You need to start it as administrator, but than <code>docker-compose</code> needs to be run as administrator too. And that doesn't play well with the Docker extension in VSCode. It's probably just me, but after some trial and error I decided it was easier to switch back to Docker Desktop through winget.</p></div>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/scoop","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-hypervisor-conundrum"},"metadata":{"title":"The Hypervisor Conundrum","date":"June 21st, 2022","tags":["windows"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1056462243"]}
